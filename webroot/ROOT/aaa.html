Welcome to Taft Law, gentlemen.

70
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:41,168
Before we get started,
a little housekeeping.

71
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,338
Um, all of you know
this young man

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,042
as the dedicated Taft associate
who, for the past eight years,

73
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:50,310
has buried himself
in the Superfund law.

74
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,646
- I'm not paying for that cleanup.
- (laughter)

Well, still it is my pleasure
to share with you

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,218
that just last week Rob Bilott
was welcomed as a partner

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,021
- here at Taft, Stettinius & Hollister.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,333
Good morning. Taft Law.

83
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,538
One moment, please.

84
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:20,608
It's the governor's office
calling for, um...

85
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,312
calling for Mr. Burke.

86
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,047
May I help you?

00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:29,149
Wilbur Tennant
calling on Robbie Bilott.

88
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,151
ROB: EPA saddled them
with the whole bill,

89
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,021
and given your client's history
at that site,

90
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,887
that-that's a real possibility.

91
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,057
- LAWYER: I'll take it back to them.
- TOM: Good.

92
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:39,293
Tab 12, Middletown...

93

KATHLEEN:
I know. I'm sorry.

94
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:44,697
- But they won't leave.
- Who's "they"?

95
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,066
I don't know.

96
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,071
They say they know you.

97
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:52,874
ROB:
Um...

98
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,375
Robbie Bilott?

99
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:57,678
Um... yes.

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,014
They call it a landfill.

101
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:02,048
A dump's what it is.

102
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,718
They told my brother and me
no chemicals, just trash,

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,254
but we ain't stupid.

104
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:07,689
Made them videotapes myself.

105
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,255
All the proof you need.

106
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,125
They're poisoning the creek,
killing my animals.

107
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,694
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- So I want a lawyer.

108
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:15,762
Every damn one in Parkersburg
too yellow to take my case.

109
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:17,165
RECEPTIONIST: Rob, he wants you
back in there.

110
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,033
WILBUR: They're all
scared shitless of DuPont.

111
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,668
Well, I ain't scared of nobody.

112
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,670
Okay. Kathleen is my paralegal.

113
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,738
She's gonna give you
a directory of lawyers.

114
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,343
That's why I called
your grandma.

115
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,410
What?

116
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:32,279
My neighbor tells me,
"Call Alma White.

117
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,148
"Her grandson's some
fancy environment lawyer

118
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,716
down in Cincinnati."

119
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,117
RECEPTIONIST:
Reception.

120
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,386
Yes, sir, he's right here.
Uh, yes...

121
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,723
(chuckling):
Uh, sir,

122
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:44,091
I am a corporate
defense attorney.

123
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,292
So?

124
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:47,226
I defend chemical companies.

125
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,064
Well, now you can defend me.

126
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,831
TOM:
Rob.

127
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:53,468
Uh, thir-thirty seconds, Tom.

128
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,970
- Uh, uh, I'm sorry, Mister...?
- Tennant.

129
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,706
I can offer you a referral,
but I'm just...

130
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:01,341
I-I just don't see how
I can be of any help to you.

131
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,377
You can start by watching
them tapes, for one thing.

132
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,345
Oh, let's go, Earl.

133
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,247
I'm sorry.
I-I-I-I wish you all the luck.

134
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,716
Don't need your damn luck, boy.

135
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,218
- I need your help.
- TOM: Rob!

136
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,420
KATHLEEN: I'll be back
for this, all right?

137
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:13,721
RECEPTIONIST:
Okay, sure.

138
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,355
Come on.

139
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:17,360
¢Ü ¢Ü

140
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,832
I'm not arguing
with the overall analysis.

141
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,170
My only point is that
whatever we decide upon...

142
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,042
LAWYER:
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

143
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,810
(quiet murmuring)

144
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,848
- Do you know where we're going?
- It's, uh...

145
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,215
- a place right around the corner.
- Yeah?

146
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:42,720
What the hell was that
all about?

147
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,853
He knows my grandmother.

148
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,154
Really?

149
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,192
Well, m-my mom's from
West Virginia,

150
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,358
uh, uh, from a town,
Parkersburg.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,129
Not us. My-my-my father
was Air Force.

152
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,430
We-we moved around a lot,
but we spent the summers there.

153
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,132
STEVE:
Come on, Terp. You're buying.

154
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,201
Of course I am.

155
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:03,170
You can be from
West Virginia, Rob.

156
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:05,175
I won't tell anyone.

157
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:12,247
TOM: All right, gentlemen.
Morton's it is.

158
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,415
- Three martini lunch.
- (sighs)

159
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,187
Still deign to eat
with us lowly associates?

160
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:22,023
You can't drive
an American car.

161
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,893
Taft-Hartley, union busting?

162
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:26,959
We practically invented it.

163
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,529
"We"? Besides, I know
a highly esteemed partner

164
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,964
who still drives American.

165
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,265
Some real clunkers, too.

166
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,134
Okay, yeah,
but-but he collects them.

167
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,370
That's different.

168
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,404
Like his no-name college
and law school.

169
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,005
- No offense.
- Are you listening to this?

170
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,440
H-Hey, you guys go ahead,
all right?

171
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,075
Hey, look, I-I didn't mean
anything by it.

172
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,443
Oh, no, I got to make a call.

173
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:45,011
It's all right.
I'll see you there.

174
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,947
- Okay, we'll save you a fish log.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,349
KARLA:
You can be such an asshole.

176
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,351
JAMES:
Karla, it was a joke.

177
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,120
- KARLA: Yeah.
- JAMES: We always joke.

178
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,255
KARLA: Oh, yeah, you guys
are a couple of jokesters.

179
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:57,460
- Anyway...
- (line ringing)

180
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:07,366
ALMA (recorded): You've reached
the residence of Alma White.

181
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:10,303
I can't come to the phone
right now...

182
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:11,572
He's good.

183
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,573
He's home early tonight,
actually.

184
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,144
SARAH'S MOM (over phone): Tell
him I say, "Howdy, partner."

185
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,577
She says, "Howdy, partner."

186
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,413
SARAH'S MOM: Are we ever gonna
see him again on Sundays?

187
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,615
SARAH: Yes, he can still come
to Sunday dinners, Mom.

188
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:23,549
He's a partner, not the
President of the United States.

189
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,019
SARAH'S MOM: I want to make...
Oh, do you have my bundt pan?

190
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,955
- Returned it.
- Where? I looked under the counter.

191
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:30,091
It's in the right-hand
cupboard, in the plastic.

192
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,592
- Yeah.
- Oh. I-I thought...

193
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,628
- Okay, well, we just sat down.
- All right, dear.

194
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,563
- SARAH: So I got to go.
- Love to Rob and Teddy.

195
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,397
SARAH:
All right, see you Sunday.

196
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,332
- Love to Dad.
- Talk to you later.

197
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,368
SARAH: Can you pretend to be
surprised about the cake?

198
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,202
She wants it to be
very special.

199
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,938
Oh, and the granite samples
came in.

200
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,006
Can you pick them up
on your way home tomorrow?

201
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:48,442
- ROB: Mm.
- Rob?

202
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:51,010
Hmm? Oh, sure.

203
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,313
SARAH (whispers): Father, Son
and the Spirit. Thank you.

204
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:56,183
(Teddy fussing)

205
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,086
You okay?

206
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,187
Yes.

207
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,889
(gasps)
Bless us, our Lord,

208
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,589
and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive

209
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,157
from thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord.

210
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,558
Amen. Thank you, God,
for our food.

211
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,594
Thank you for family.

212
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,296
Mm... (smacking lips)

213
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,301
¢Ü ¢Ü

214
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,489
¢Ü ¢Ü

215
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,004
¢Ü ¢Ü

216
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,457
(quietly):
Thank you.

217
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,903
¢Ü ¢Ü

218
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,543
(engine idling loudly)

219
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:32,312
(engine stops)

220
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:35,282
(birds chirping)

221
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,287
(train horn blows in distance)

222
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:41,325
(knocking)

223
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,697
Hi, Grammers.

224
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,164
(laughing):
What on earth?

225
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,701
- (gasps) I...
- I tried to call, but you weren't picking up.

226
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:57,004
ALMA:
Oh, well, you know me.

227
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:59,639
My two fake knees.
(laughs)

228
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,979
What are you doing here?

229
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:07,250
A, uh, farmer came to see me.

230
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:10,649
Wilbur Tennant?

231
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,452
You do know him.

232
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:17,024
I don't socialize with him,
if that's what you mean.

233
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,260
Inez Graham owned the farm
next to his.

234
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,261
I used to take you and Beth
over there

235
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,130
when you were little.

236
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,133
That's the place?

237
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,636
(Alma scoffs quietly)

238
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:33,976
(drawer opens)

239
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,615
(chuckles)

240
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:44,116
- You rode that pony.
- Ah.

241
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,552
(Alma laughing)

242
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,788
ROB:
I loved that place.

243
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,690
ALMA: You saw a cow
for the first time.

244
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,659
Learned to milk it.

245
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:55,096
I remember you
sitting there for hours

246
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:57,731
making sure you got
every last drop.

247
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,634
Just like you.

248
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,437
There.

249
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:04,072
ROB:
Mm.

250
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,206
ALMA:
So, you gonna help him?

251
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,144
Huh?

252
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,485
(engine rattling and grinding)

253
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:27,364
(machinery whirring, beeping)

254
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,705
(machinery rattling)

255
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:57,823
WILBUR:
You come up the holler.

256
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,196
Dump's up the hill.

257
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,366
Since I started complaining
about my creek, fence goes up.

258
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,705
- All blocked off.
- (dishes clattering)

259
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,142
Hi. I'm Rob.

260
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:16,678
Sandra.

261
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,447
WILBUR: The state,
and every veterinarian

262
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,414
I called in Parkersburg,

263
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,217
they will not return
my phone calls.

264
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,419
- Like I bite the hand that feeds.
- No, it's all right.

265
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,188
- I've already...
- This here's a gall.

266
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,591
Look at the size of it.

267
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,159
Ain't never seen
no gall that big.

268
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,360
Bigger than the heart.

269
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,361
That your cow's?

270
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,167
Look at them teeth.

271
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:41,638
Black as night. Here.

272
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,272
(Wilbur grunts)

273
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,240
Hoof, all turned in on itself.

274
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:50,446
Half my calves born
hooves like that.

275
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:55,515
Tumor I done cut off
the back a heifer.

276
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,720
How'd you like that
on your table?

277
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,657
ROB:
What am I looking for?

278
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:06,226
You blind, boy?

279
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:10,197
Stones as white
as the hairs on my head.

280
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,201
Bleached. That's chemicals,
I'm telling you.

281
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:17,871
My animals drink this water,
cool off in there.

282
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,841
Get them bloody welts,
them dead eyes.

283
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,609
Charge at me, crazy-like.

284
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,779
Animals that used to eat
out of my own hand.

285
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,885
(cow lowing nearby)

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,321
ROB:
Where are the rest of them?

287
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,557
Come on.

288
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:49,635
In the beginning,
I'd bury 'em, each one.

289
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,639
They're family.

290
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,611
It got to be so many,
pile 'em up, set fire to...

291
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,248
How many did you lose?

292
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,019
- A hundred... ninety.
- (Rob exhales sharply)

293
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,621
190 cows?

294
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:10,490
You tell me
nothing's wrong here.

295
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,495
¢Ü ¢Ü

296
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,865
ROB:
And...

297
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,269
this landfill
wasn't always here?

298
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,669
WILBUR:
No.

299
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,671
My brother Jim
used to dig ditches

300
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,274
over at DuPont plant.

301
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,274
Got sick,
couldn't do it no more.

302
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,808
One day, they come to him,

303
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:33,014
offering to buy his land
right up that holler.

304
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:34,947
They promised no chemicals.

305
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,717
And I assume
you reached out to DuPont?

306
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,818
DuPont, the state, the Feds.

307
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:42,956
I called everybody there is
dozens of times.

308
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,058
EPA finally comes out here.

309
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,626
- Oh, they did?
- Well, all for some report.

310
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:49,062
What did it say?

311
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:51,500
You think they're
gonna show me?

312
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,979
¢Ü ¢Ü

313
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,455
(brakes squeal)

314
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,758
SARAH (sighing):
Oh, hey.

315
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,428
(Teddy squeals, cries)

316
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,998
- He's been like this all day.
- (children's song playing)

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,099
- Okay. Go on.
- Come here. Aw.

318
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,969
- (Sarah sighs)
- Aw.

319
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,604
(crying stops)

320
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:33,606
SARAH: Of course you're
a perfect angel for Daddy.

321
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,541
- (Sarah sighs heavily)
- (crying continues)

322
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:37,010
Did you get the tile?

323
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,347
Um, I'm sorry. No.

324
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:43,017
- Rob.
- (crying stops)

325
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,086
I didn't drive into town today.
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,020
Wh-What do you mean,
you didn't drive into town?

327
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:51,523
- (crying continues)
- I-I... I had to go to Parkersburg.

328
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:53,859
Parkersburg? Why'd you have
to go to Parkersburg?

329
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,627
Uh...

330
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,932
I-I-I may have a client there.

331
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,933
- In West Virginia?
- (crying stops)

332
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:02,403
What kind of a case
would you have...?

333
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,703
He's a farmer.
He knows my grammer.

334
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,640
- Not well, but...
- So, you saw her?

335
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,009
(Rob chuckles)

336
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,412
- Was your mother there?
- Oh, come on, Sarah.

337
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,913
I didn't... I didn't sneak off
to see my mother.

338
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,914
So, why did you sneak off?

339
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,651
I didn't.

340
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:19,586
(garbage disposal grinding)

341
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:23,722
Our speaker tonight's
no stranger to the Taft family.

342
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:26,894
Phillip Donnelly... Phil to us...

343
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:30,498
serves as in-house
corporate counsel at DuPont.

344
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Not only one of America's most
revered chemical companies,

345
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:38,137
but one of the few giants
of the industry

346
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,539
that Taft doesn't represent.

347
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,040
Not yet, anyway.

348
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,711
- That's the spirit, James.
- (laughter, murmuring)

349
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,614
We asked Phil here tonight

350
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:48,847
not just to show him
what he's missing,

351
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:52,720
but to hear how a renowned
leader of our industry

352
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,721
stays that way.

353
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,960
Please welcome Phil Donnelly.

354
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:00,859
Wish me luck.

355
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:02,163
Go get 'em, Phil.

356
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:03,529
Thank you.

357
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,164
PHIL:
At DuPont, w-we're not

358
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,166
producing chemicals
for chemicals' sake.

359
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,470
We're producing them
for people's sake.

360
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,938
To make folks' lives easier,

361
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,474
happier, longer.

362
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:20,114
That's why "better living
through chemistry"

363
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,849
is not just a slogan at DuPont.

364
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,689
- It's our DNA.
- (crowd murmuring)

365
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,592
- Hey, Rob.
- Hello, Phil.

366
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,161
Is it true what Tom tells me?

367
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,761
- Yeah, it's true.
- Well, good on them.

368
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,630
- They're lucky to have you.
- Thanks, Phil.

369
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,567
Like I always tell
my young associates,

370
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:41,969
just keep your head down
and do the work.

371
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:45,940
Thanks. Uh, Phil, can I ask you
sort of an odd question?

372
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,508
Shoot.

373
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:50,978
Does the name Wilbur Tennant
ring a bell?

374
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,246
- Tennet, did you say?
- Tennant.

375
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:55,647
No, not that I recall.

376
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,784
Mr. Tennant's a-a farmer
from West Virginia.

377
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:00,886
His property abuts one
of your landfills, Dry Run.

378
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,888
And his cows have been
getting sick,

379
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,959
he thinks possibly
because of the runoff

380
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,826
from the landfill
into his creek.

381
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,895
You're kidding.
How did this come to you?

382
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:10,230
- (stammering) - KIM: Hey, Phil.
- PHIL: Uh...

383
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:13,000
He's a... a farmer. He's...

384
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,666
My grandmother's
from Parkersburg.

385
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,970
Really?

386
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:17,238
Washington Works.
Great plant.

387
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,672
Right.
She knows the Tennants.

388
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:19,905
So, Grandma's
on your back, huh?

389
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,106
- Something like that.
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:22,875
Anyway, uh...

391
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:25,244
the farmer said the EPA
came out, took a look around.

392
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:26,746
I-I wondered...

393
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,580
- The name of the landfill again?
- Dry Run.

394
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,518
Dry Run. Dry...

395
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,986
You know, that does ring a bell,
now that you mention it.

396
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,887
We may have even sent
some folks out there,

397
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,923
if I remember correctly,
to help EPA check it out.

398
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,290
Th-Th-That's got to be it.

399
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,260
So, I-I'd love to share
whatever came of that

400
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,663
with, uh, Mr. Tennant,
help settle his nerves.

401
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:45,531
Absolutely. Soon as I'm back
in Wilmington, I'll take a look.

402
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,067
Thanks, Phil.
I-I really appreciate it.

403
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:48,800
Happy to do it.

404
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:52,070
Now, let's get a drink
and toast you, my friend. You.

405
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:53,941
- (chuckling): All right.
- Okay, then.

408
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,692
Mr. Tennant.

409
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,798
I have the report.

410
00:21:16,598 --> 00:21:17,865
Sons of bitches.

411
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,798
Who the hell
they think they are?

412
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,201
Who gives them the right?!

413
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:23,604
- It's an evaluation.
- "Evalu..."

414
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,837
Hatchet job's what it is.

415
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,973
I've been farming
my entire life.

416

417

You read that.

You tell me
you recognize my farm.

00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:26,444
Anyway, her eyes are sunk
way back in her head.

480
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:29,952
- (flies buzzing)
- She's poor as a whip-poor-will.

481
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:32,984
And I'm gonna cut her open

482
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:36,923
and find out what caused her
to... to die.

483
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:38,991
'Cause I was feeding her
enough feed

484
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:40,425
that she should've gained weight

485
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,260
instead of losing weight.

486
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:45,597
This is what her teeth
looks like.

487
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,534
- (flies buzzing)
- That's the upper one.

488
00:25:48,536 --> 00:25:50,569
But this one here,

489
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:54,207
I've never seen any-anything
like it in my lifetime.

490
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:56,576
Even the veterinarian,
he'd been in it,

491
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,577
he would've never saw anything
like this before

492
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,579
in his life, either.

493
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:03,148
(flies buzzing)

494
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:06,019
(static hissing)

495
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,557
(Rob clears throat softly)

496
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,960
TOM:
So, what...

497
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,626
are you proposing we do?

498
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,962
File a claim,
trigger discovery,

499
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:19,397
and find out
what's in that landfill.

500
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,433
You want to sue DuPont?

501
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,903
Targeted. Property dispute.

502
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:25,371
- Routine stuff.
- Not routine.

503
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:27,007
Not around here.

504
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:29,375
I know, but, Tom,
if you'd actually seen it.

505
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:31,478
H-His farm is like a graveyard.

506
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,445
There-there's something
very wrong.

507
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:36,048
So he should hire
a local lawyer.

508
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,451
None of them will do it.

509
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,484
Th-They're all terrified
of DuPont.

510
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,221
- Well, what does that tell you?
- We know DuPont.

511
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:44,089
They're gonna want to hear if

512
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:45,924
some of their local guys
are screwing something up.

513
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:49,462
Oh, oh, oh, so-so-so they're
gonna thank us for suing them?

514
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,298
Better us than the EPA.

515
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,964
I mean, new partners
are supposed to

516
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,201
bring in business, right?

517
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,568
So your farmer can swing
$275 an hour?

518
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,938
It'd be, uh, on-on contingency.

519
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,240
(sighs) Jesus.

520
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:02,173
What are we,
coupon chasers now?

521
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:04,644
It's a small matter
for a family friend.

522
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:06,980
I'll get in, and I'll get out.

523
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,580
Help a guy who needs it.

524
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,185
Who? The farmer or you?

525
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,058
(long sigh)

526
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:21,263
(Rob clears throat, sighs)

527
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:33,173
Surgical. You hear me?

528
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:36,241
Absolutely. Thank you.

529
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:38,109
PHIL (over phone):
<i>Come on, Rob.</i>

530
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,113
<i>Of course I'm gonna
take your call.</i>

531
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,682
<i>Even though I was, I admit,</i>

532
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,082
a little surprised.

533
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:45,952
I mean, getting sued
by Taft Law?

534
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,954
It's not every day...
or any day, frankly.

535
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:50,455
I know. I'm sorry.

536
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:54,059
Look, you and I are friends.
This is a minor issue.

537
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,096
No reason it should get messy.

538
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,964
ROB: Uh, thank you.
I, uh, totally agree.

539
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,367
- Yeah, I'm putting you on speakerphone.
- (phone beeps)

540
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,438
PHIL: So, you want to know
if we violated our permits.

541
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,173
Pretty much, yeah.

542
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:09,375
PHIL: Okay, then.
I'll have our guys send over

543
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:12,310
anything related
to hazardous waste at Dry Run,

544
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:15,382
and I'll tell them
to hurry it up this time.

545
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:16,750
- How's that?
- ROB: Thank you.

546
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:18,585
- That sounds great.
- PHIL: And don't stress.

547
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,356
- I forgive you.
- ROB: Thanks, Phil.

548
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:29,260
- (birds chirping)
- (kids chattering in distance)

549
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,934
(vehicle approaching)

550
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,577
You took your baby
into the office.

551
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:46,546
(groans)
I needed a bigger trunk.

552
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,213
Why?

553
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:51,116
- Discovery for the Tennant case came in today.
- Oh.

554
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:52,586
SARAH:
<i>Oh, you started before me.</i>

555
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,354
- You're so fast!
- Oh, you like that?

556
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,755
What do you think about that?

557
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:57,557
- SARAH'S MOM: Good boy.
- (sighs)

558
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:00,125
Rob's missing
such a lovely day.

559
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:02,294
Law's a jealous mistress, Mom.

560
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:03,762
Means it comes
with the territory.

561
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,432
- Let's go over here!
- (yells playfully)

562
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,731
SARAH'S BROTHER:
Nice! Thank you.

563
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:08,666
That's what I'm talking
about right there.

564
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,037
SPORTSCASTER:
No score, just underway

565
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,636
in the top of the first.

566
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:13,606
BROTHER: All right, let's go.
One more, one more.

567
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,273
All right.

568
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:17,277
(sportscast continues
indistinctly)

569
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:19,281
¢Ü ¢Ü

570
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:29,358
(papers rustling)

571
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,661
(mutters):
"Poly."

572
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:36,365
What's that?

573
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,237
¢Ü ¢Ü

574
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:54,480
No.

575
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,652
- Mm...
- (typing)

576
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,489
KIM: How's my favorite
plaintiff's attorney?

577
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,324
Hey, help me out, will you?

578
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:06,393
You're a run-of-a-mill dump,
nothing but trash.

579
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:08,161
You sound like
my first girlfriend.

580
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:09,694
(chuckles)

581
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:14,099
Why a requisition order
for 55-gallon containers?

582
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:15,568
Conspiracy.

583
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,104
Standard-size drums.

584
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:18,837
Ash, ash by-product,

585
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,472
glass tubing,
plastic, paper waste.

586
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,807
It's just trash.

587
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:23,710
You pile it onto a truck,
drive it away.

588
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,111
You don't pack it into drums.

589
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,278
So they've got liquid waste.

590
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,512
Not hazardous.

591
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:28,780
Or they'd have to disclose it.

592
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:31,250
So, what-what is
killing these cows?

593
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:33,854
- It's not paper and ash.
- Well, maybe it's human error.

594
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:36,521
They're dumping something in
there they don't know is toxic.

595
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:38,325
(chuckling):
Kim, it's DuPont.

596
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:40,859
They-they know more
than the EPA does.

597
00:30:40,862 --> 00:30:42,694
Everyone knows
more than the EPA does.

598
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:45,434
Why else would they let us
regulate ourselves?

599
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,433
What?

600
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:49,734
Do we?

601
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:52,438
Do we what?

602
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,174
The EPA only started
regulating chemicals in '76.

603
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:58,176
- Yeah?
- They grandfather in

604
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,645
every existing chemical
nonhazardous

605
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:03,182
unless they knew
it was hazardous

606
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:04,884
or a company told them it was.

607
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:06,818
- We're saying the same thing.
- No, we're not.

608
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,326
I'm saying,
what if a company didn't tell?

609
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,327
What if the reason

610
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,565
Phil Donnelly agreed
to discovery on hazardous

611
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,902
is because he knows
whatever's in that landfill

612
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:23,769
isn't even regulated?

613
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,205
Okay, now you are sounding
like a plaintiff's attorney.

614
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,642
I've got a meeting.

615
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,241
Hey. Oh, wait one second.

616
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:34,681
Have you... have you heard
of this, um, PFOA?

617
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:36,214
No.

618
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,616
Uh, you know,
it's mentioned here,

619
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:39,318
but I-I can't find
anything about it

620
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,685
in any of the literature.

621
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:42,587
I don't even know
if it's a chemical.

622
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,257
Ask Phil.

623
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:45,692
Well, thank you.

624
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:47,358
SECRETARY:
<i>As I said,</i>

625
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,327
Mr. Donnelly is still
out of town.

626
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:51,529
Well, I-I called last week
and left two messages

627
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:53,398
and haven't heard back
from him.

628
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:55,402
SECRETARY: I will be sure to
tell him that you called again.

629
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,604
- Okay. Damn it.
- (hangs up phone)

630
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:00,606
- Your tickets to the Chemical Alliance dinner.
- (Rob groans)

631
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:04,476
And no, dark suit is not
the same as black tie.

632
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:05,814
Wouldn't he be going?

633
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,816
(band playing soft jazz music)

634
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,820
(quiet chatter)

635
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,935
(indistinct chatter)

636
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,674
(Sarah laughing)

637
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:38,478
I don't know if Rob told you,

638
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,680
but I was a receptionist
at Taft before law school.

639
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:42,481
- Is that right?
- Yeah. But, well,

640
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,950
I think the right Bilott
ended up there.

641
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,518
- Harold, you're not getting away from me.
- Oh.

642
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,885
- Would you excuse me?
- Sure, it was...

643
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,555
It's great to see you.

644
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:49,788
Uh, when is the...

645
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,490
- (laughing)
- That's funny.

646
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:54,693
Ah. Right away, I saw
a little of myself in Rob.

647
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:57,395
- Oh.
- One black sheep to another.

648
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:59,265
My dad was a steelworker,
you know.

649
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:02,269
- (gasps) Was he? - Yeah.
- Have-have you seen Phil?

650
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,702
KIM:
No.

651
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,305
GERALD:
<i>So, you're an attorney?</i>

652
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:07,507
Oh, uh, recovering.

653
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:10,476
I represented employers
in workmen comp disputes,

654
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:12,577
but now I stay at home
with our baby.

655
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:14,579
(chuckles) Well, that's
the thing with lady lawyers.

656
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:16,281
- WOMAN: Oh. Oh, Gerald!
- MAN: Oh.

657
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:18,349
I want to say hi to the
Dow folks. Have you seen them?

658
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,617
No, I've been...
I've been looking for Phil.

659
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,020
Did I tell you
they sent me some work?

660
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:22,855
Dow? That's great.

661
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:24,923
Just a small project,
like a tryout,

662
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:27,992
but if I impress them, can you
imagine if I brought on Dow?

663
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:30,962
- (Rob chuckling)
- Uh, n-none for me, thank you.

664
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,968
ROB:
You're not...?

665
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,769
I'm, um...

666
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,436
You're...?

667
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,307
- She's... You...
- I'm... (sighs)

668
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,976
I'm gonna wait as long as I can
to tell the firm, obviously.

669
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,412
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

670
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,744
These lady lawyers
need a quick sidebar.

671
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:47,681
- ROB: Congratulations.
- KARLA: Thank you.

672
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,080
- GERALD: Of course.
- ROB: No, no, no...

673
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,481
SARAH:
He probably signs your paycheck.

674
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:52,652
- Be nice to him.
- Don't leave me.

675
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:53,818
(Sarah and Karla laughing)

676
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,355
SARAH:
Congratulations.

677
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,388
KARLA:
I know. I can't believe it.

678
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,394
(indistinct chatter)

679
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:03,962
Uh, uh, excuse me.

680
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:05,967
¢Ü ¢Ü

681
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,007
Uh, Rob, how are you?

682
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:15,740
Yeah, Phil, I've been...
been trying to reach you.

683
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:16,643
So sorry, all this traveling.

684
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:18,077
How about I give you
a shout tomorrow?

685
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,679
We're gonna need
to broaden discovery

686
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,847
to everything in that landfill,
hazardous or not.

687
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,952
TOM: Turns out, good lawyer.
Turned out...

688
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,119
Excuse me.

689
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:28,954
You kidding me?

690
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:32,125
ROB:
No. Um...

691
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:34,827
I-I think whatever's
causing problems in there

692
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:38,063
isn't something the EPA
regulates or knows to regulate.

693
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:39,599
Sorry?

694
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,432
I'm-I'm seeing things
in your documents

695
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,869
I don't understand.

696
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,637
Y-You're seeing ghosts
is what you're seeing.

697
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
And, frankly, you're making
an ass of yourself.

698
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:48,375
O-Okay, then...
then help me out.

699
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:49,875
I mean... I mean, like this.

700
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:53,711
I mean, what...
what is this, uh, PFOA?

701
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:56,882
- What's that stand for?
- (exhales sharply)

702
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:58,817
Jesus.

703
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,086
You're on a goddamn
fishing expedition.

704
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,123
You want to...
you want to flush your career

705
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,858
down the toilet
for some cowhand?

706
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Be my guest.
I'm done helping you.

707
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:09,695
Phil, I need to insist
on broadening discovery.

708
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,097
- Sue me!
- I'm...

709
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,534
- already suing you.
- STEVE: Welcome, everyone,

710
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:17,536
to the 14th annual
Ohio Chemical Alliance...

711
00:35:17,538 --> 00:35:19,873
- Fuck you!
- ...awards dinner.

712
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,907
(applause)

713
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:23,811
Hick.

714
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:30,682
STEVE:
So, let's get the fun started!

715
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:32,688
(guests murmuring)

716
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:52,172
I'm sorry.

717
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:55,510
SARAH: You're not the only one
who's sacrificed.

718
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:03,516
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

719
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:06,956
(door opens, closes)

720
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:12,125
You know the difference between
business and pleasure, right?

721
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:14,126
So, why on earth
would you engage

722
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,996
in business conversations
at a public function?

723
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:19,465
ROB:
Tom. He's hiding something.

724
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,833
You saw his reaction.

725
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:22,768
Yeah, me and everyone
in that room.

726
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,603
Taft in a pissing match
with DuPont.

727
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:26,639
I am gonna get a court order
and force them

728
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:28,474
to tell me everything
that's in that landfill.

729
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:30,710
Jesus Christ, now you want
to actually take them to court.

730
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:32,679
And I'm gonna need
local counsel in West Virginia.

731
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:34,246
What happened to routine stuff?

732
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:36,715
- Get in, get out? God!
- Ask Phil Donnelly.

733
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:38,550
LARRY:
<i>Of course I remember you.</i>

734
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:39,619
(chuckles)

735
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:41,855
Yeah, last time I saw you,
I think Phil Donnelly

736
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,789
was trying to get you
to go out on the links with us.

737
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,525
- (chuckling): Yeah.
- ROB: Actually I'm suing him

738
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:48,094
and I was looking for
some advice on local counsel.

739
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,028
You what?

740
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,034
¢Ü ¢Ü

741
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,146
- Larry.
- Thank you.

742
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:12,688
- Good morning.
- Okay.

743
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:17,159
- Good morning, Larry.
- Morning.

744
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,697
Morning, Miss Claire.

745
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:27,766
Don't you look nice.

746
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,902
Save it for the judge,
Mr. Winter.

747
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:32,005
(chuckles)

748
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:35,942
CLAIRE:
You're suing DuPont.

749
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:37,677
(stamp clicking)

750
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,679
LARRY:
Yes, ma'am.

751
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,648
You represent DuPont.

752
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,981
My old firm did.

753
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,987
I've been out on my own
for a while.

754
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:48,190
Good luck with that.

755
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:54,760
PHIL: <i>Just wanted
to let you know personally</i>

756
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:58,297
that your court-ordered
discovery is on the way.

757
00:37:58,298 --> 00:37:59,998
Thanks, Phil.

758
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,637
No, it's my pleasure.

759
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,938
Discovery.

760
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,942
(quiet mechanical rattling)

761
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,853
(heavy thud)

762
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:22,922
Son of a bitch.

763
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,791
All right, no admission
of liability.

764
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,297
- And non...
- (wheels rattling)

765
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:33,268
Nondisclosure
of any and all terms.

766
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:36,105
Pardon me a moment.

767
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,211
(indistinct chatter)

768
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,748
(grunting)

769
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:52,851
Thanks.

770
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:55,822
Holy Jesus.

771
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,724
- What in the...
- Thanks.

772
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,393
...world?

773
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:02,661
I guess the joke's on me.

774
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,297
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

775
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:06,032
No one can go through
all this crap,

776
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:07,733
not in a million years.

777
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,971
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's what they're banking on.

778
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,273
- ROB: Oh, goddamn it!
- Oh, God, Rob.

779
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:16,311
(coughing)

780
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:20,880
- Here, let me...
- No, no, no, you...

781
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:23,148
you shouldn't be
around this stuff.

782
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,349
You sure?

783
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:25,751
I'm-I'm positive.

784
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:26,952
Thank you, though.

785
00:39:26,954 --> 00:39:29,255
Yeah.

786
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,193
Good luck.

787
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:43,237
(sighs)

788
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:50,077
(whispers):
Yeah.

789
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,083
1957.

790
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:57,818
(whispers):
Yeah.

791
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:01,289

- (quiet chatter)
- (music playing faintly)

795
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:04,083
Hey, Bobby. How you...

796
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,688
What are you having?

797
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:09,788
Usual.

798
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,824
Eggs over, bacon and grits.

799
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:14,362
Same.

800
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,235
BOBBY:
I need two over, grits, twice.

801
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:32,844
WILBUR:
<i>Wilbur Tennant.</i>

802
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:33,913
KATHLEEN:
He's not in his office.

803
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:36,047
- Can I take a message?
- I been leaving messages.

804
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,983
I know, Mr. Tennant,
but he really can't

805
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:40,186
- get to the phone right now.
- I want service! (coughs)

806
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,987
I'll let him know
that you called again.

807
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,291
- WILBUR: For Christ's sakes.
- (click, dial tone)

808
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,193
Is she getting accustomed
to being at Mom and Dad's?

809
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:49,494
BETH (breaking up):
Well, you know Grammer.

810
00:41:49,496 --> 00:41:51,463
- She misses her own house.
- What? Uh...

811
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,266
BETH:
She misses her own house.

812
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:55,067
ROB:
Um, I have a bad cell.

813
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:57,302
I said Grammer misses
her own house.

814
00:41:57,304 --> 00:42:00,306
Okay, can... can you...
can I talk to her?

815
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:02,275
Well, she and Mom
are at the doctor's.

816
00:42:02,277 --> 00:42:04,110
Will you... will you tell
Grammers I called?

817
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:05,577
Rob, you're-you're breaking...
you're breaking...

818
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,813
- ROB: And Mom, too.
- Let's try again on Sunday.

819
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,250
ROB:
All right.

820
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:14,222
(sighs)

821
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:18,159
ROB:
"C-8."

822
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:25,998
You know you look
like a crazy person, right?

823
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,900
Wh-What was the name of that...
that guy that you brought by?

824
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,335
- The, um... (snaps fingers)
- What guy?

825
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:32,971
The-the-the...
th-th-the chemistry expert.

826
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:35,242
- The guy who does the models.
- Gillespie.

827
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,878
Here you go.

828
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,480
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:43,983
Kim Burke had
an expense account.

830
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,217
Oh, sorry.

831
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:46,885
- It's not that kind of case.
- Hmm.

832
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:51,025
Are you familiar
with something called PFOA?

833
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,096
No.

834
00:42:56,096 --> 00:42:58,264
No. No.

835
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:02,300
I did read something recently
about a PFOS, I think it was.

836
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:03,938
That-that sounds related.

837
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:07,072
ROB:
And what was that?

838
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:09,875
Long-chain fluorocarbon,
synthetic.

839
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:11,476
(chuckles) I'm sorry.

840
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:14,179
Chemistry was my worst class
in high school.

841
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:16,983
(chuckling): Boy, you in
the wrong line of work.

842
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:19,251
Tell me about it. So?

843
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:20,619
So, synthetic.

844
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:22,288
- Right? Man-made.
- Mm-hmm.

845
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:25,291
- Uh, Frankenstein.
- (chuckles) And?

846
00:43:25,293 --> 00:43:27,927
Um, long-chain fluorocarbon

847
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:31,963
is a sequence of carbon atoms,
add a fluoride.

848
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:35,500
All right, in-in the lab,
you take a-a carbon atom.

849
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:39,471
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you add another carbon atom.

850
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:42,641
And then another and another.

851
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:44,210
Look.

852
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:47,516
Y-You're making a chain, right?

853
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,317
Right?

854
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:53,619
ROB:
Could it be... eight?

855
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:55,019
Eight carbons?

856
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:56,255
GILLESPIE:
Well, sure. Yeah.

857
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:58,324
In the lab, you can do
almost anything.

858
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,659
ROB:
And why-why would you want to?

859
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:03,295
Make this, I mean.

860
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:06,097
Well, a chain like that's
pretty much unbreakable,

861
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,565
biochemically speaking.

862
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:11,237
So, uh, industrial uses,
I imagine.

863
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,105
3M made it.

864
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:15,574
They don't anymore.
That's what I read.

865
00:44:15,576 --> 00:44:17,442
And why did they stop?

866
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:19,380
Didn't say.

867
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:23,081
What if...

868
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,253
What if you drank it?

869
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:28,688
Drank it?

870
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,422
You don't.

871
00:44:30,423 --> 00:44:32,458
- But what if you did?
- WAITRESS: Ready to order?

872
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,592
- Yeah, I think I'd like a, um...
- Wait, what...

873
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,063
What if you did?

874
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:41,099
That's like saying,
"What if I swallowed a tire?"

875
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:42,534
I don't know.

876
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:45,304
You want to be the guy
that finds out?

877
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:46,909
Tuna melt.

878
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:53,081
- (church organ playing)
- (quiet chatter)

879
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:07,425
PREACHER:
Let us all begin

880
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:10,762
with hymn number 452
in our hymnal books:

881
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:12,998
"Here I Am, Lord."

882
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,666
Please rise.

883
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:17,135
¢Ü ¢Ü

884
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:18,737
CONGREGATION:
¢Ü I, the Lord ¢Ü

885
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:22,041
¢Ü Of sea and sky ¢Ü

886
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:23,708
¢Ü I have heard ¢Ü

887
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,012
¢Ü My people cry ¢Ü

888
00:45:27,014 --> 00:45:28,748
¢Ü All who dwell ¢Ü

889
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,650
¢Ü In deepest sin ¢Ü

890
00:45:31,652 --> 00:45:36,422
¢Ü My hand will save ¢Ü

891
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:38,324
¢Ü I have made... ¢Ü

892
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:39,759
TEDDY:
It makes sounds here.

893
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,693
FEMALE VOICE (recorded):
Asteroid ahead.

894
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:44,130
(laughs, babbles)

895
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:46,664
MALE VOICE (recorded):
Are you ready to blast off?

896
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,768
(toy makes whooshing sound)

897
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:52,606
(muttering)

898
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:01,815
TEDDY:
I'm taking off that.

899
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:07,688
¢Ü ¢Ü

900
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,710
¢Ü ¢Ü

901
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,380
ROB:
You said it had fluoride?

902
00:46:34,382 --> 00:46:36,449
GILLESPIE (over phone):
What? Mr. Bilott, it's Sunday.

903
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:39,351
That chemical, you said
it had a fluoride atom.

904
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:42,320
(scoffs)
It's a fluorocarbon, so yes.

905
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:43,688
Somewhere along the chain...

906
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,157
What would it do to your teeth
if you drank it?

907
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,460
Don't-don't tell me
if you shouldn't.

908
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:49,527
If you did...
if you drank a lot of it,

909
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,329
what would it do to your teeth?

910
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:53,398
Well, in trace amounts,
fluoride hardens teeth,

911
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,534
but-but too much,
it's gonna stain 'em.

912
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:59,371
I mean, even turn 'em black.

913
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:02,277
So, can I get back
to my family now?

914
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,778
Whoa, what?
Where-where are you going?

915
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,182
- It's in their water.
- What? What is?

916
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:13,554
(rummaging through boxes)

917
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,777
¢Ü ¢Ü

00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:47,585
(Wilbur coughing)

919
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:50,623
DOCTOR:
How long's the coughing been?

920
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,759
WILBUR:
Couple... couple months.

921
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,795
- A year.
- DOCTOR: You a smoker?

922
00:47:56,797 --> 00:47:59,831
No. (coughing)

923
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,635
Roll up your sleeve.
We're gonna take some blood.

924
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:07,342
(nurse clears throat)

00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,516
WILBUR:
Thought you left him inside.

928
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,552
SANDRA:
I did.

929
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:22,789
- (barking)
- (Sandra sighs)

930
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:26,324
Oh, baby.

931
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:28,226
(growls)

932
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:30,563
(barking)

933
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:36,768
You move this?

934
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:38,503
What?

935
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:39,938
Did you go through this?

936
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,608
No.

937
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:49,717
They been here. They been here.

938
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,255
(dog whining)

939
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,329

00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,639
(Wilbur coughs)

943
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:20,913
AMY:
What happened?

944
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:22,884
Wash up.

945
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:29,856

946
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:33,228
CRYSTAL:
Dad?

947
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:37,597
- AMY: What is it?
- Quiet.

948
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:40,568
(barks)

949
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:44,739
(helicopter whirring)

950
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:48,806
WILBUR:
This is my land, damn you!

951
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:50,675
You get out of here!

952
00:49:50,677 --> 00:49:51,945
Go on!

953
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,516
Go on!

954
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:57,815
- Sandra, girls, go on!
- What's going on?

955
00:49:57,817 --> 00:50:00,286
Go on, get in! Get in!

956
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:04,259
I know you!

957
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,963
¢Ü ¢Ü

958
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,983
¢Ü ¢Ü

959
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:50,371
¢Ü ¢Ü

960
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,592
¢Ü ¢Ü

961
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:35,516
¢Ü ¢Ü

962
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:44,057
(exhales sharply)

963
00:51:47,027 --> 00:51:49,030
¢Ü ¢Ü

964
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,447
(clattering in distance)

965
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:17,391
Rob?

966
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:27,735
(clattering continues)

967
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:40,913
(clattering continues)

968
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:42,648
(gasps)

969
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,949
Holy crap. Rob!

970
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,684
What?

971
00:52:46,686 --> 00:52:49,121
I thought someone was
breaking in, for God's sakes!

972
00:52:49,123 --> 00:52:51,155
- No, it's just-just me.
- Rob, you need to tell me

973
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:53,559
what in the hell's going on.

974
00:52:55,663 --> 00:52:57,931
We're being poisoned.

975
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,599
- Rob.
- What?

976
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:02,835
I'm... I mean it.

977
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:05,204
DuPont is knowingly
poisoning us.

978
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:08,172
You mean the farmer, his land.

979
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:11,108
All of us.

980
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,114
Please don't look at me
like that.

981
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:18,483
They're already
poisoning the baby.

982
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:20,485
No. No, I'm not listening
to this.

983
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:22,855
- Sarah.
- Stop it! Just stop it, okay?!

984
00:53:22,856 --> 00:53:24,088
Do you hear yourself?

985
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,625
You are acting
like a crazy person.

986
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:29,695
Tearing up our floor,
scaring me half to death.

987
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:31,528
I know it's my job
to support you,

988
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,865
but that does not mean
you get to come into our home,

989
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:35,199
to our family, and tell me

990
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:37,235
that our unborn child
is being poisoned.

991
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:39,237
- No!
- I'm sorry.

992
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,172
- Can I please explain?
- Explain what?!

993
00:53:41,173 --> 00:53:42,875
All of it.

994
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:45,878
And if-if you still think
I'm crazy, I'll drop it.

995
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,815
I swear to God.

996
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:51,117
I swear to you.

997
00:54:02,295 --> 00:54:04,731
(Rob sighs)

998
00:54:07,534 --> 00:54:10,869
There is a man-made chemical.

999
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,605
It was invented during
the Manhattan Project.

1000
00:54:13,606 --> 00:54:15,806
<i>It repelled the elements,</i>

1001
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,275
<i>especially water.</i>

1002
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:19,911
<i>So they used it to make
the first ever</i>

1003
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:21,746
<i>waterproof coating for tanks.</i>

1004
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:23,548
<i>It was indestructible.</i>

1005
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,786
Then some companies thought,
"Hey, why just the battlefield?

1006
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:31,088
Why not bring this chemical
into American homes?"

1007
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,590
SECRETARY:
<i>Rob's here.</i>

1008
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:34,293
TOM (over phone):
All right, good.

1009
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:36,063
SECRETARY:
He'll see you now.

1010
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:42,800
ROB: <i>DuPont was
one of those companies.</i>

1011
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,871
<i>So they took this chemical,
PFOA,</i>

1012
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:47,873
<i>they renamed it C-8,</i>

1013
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,208
<i>and they made their own
impenetrable coating,</i>

1014
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,210
<i>but not for tanks.</i>

1015
00:54:53,211 --> 00:54:55,646
<i>For pans.</i>

1016
00:54:55,648 --> 00:54:58,317
<i>They called it Teflon.</i>

1017
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,086
A shining symbol
of American ingenuity

1018
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:06,260
<i>made right here in the USA
in Parkersburg, West Virginia.</i>

1019
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:10,996
But right from the start,
something wasn't right.

1020
00:55:10,998 --> 00:55:14,333
The men and workers
who made Teflon

1021
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:16,735
<i>were coming down
with nausea, fevers.</i>

1022
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:18,804
<i>DuPont wanted to know why.</i>

1023
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:21,273
<i>So they laced cigarettes
with Teflon.</i>

1024
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:24,909
<i>They told a group of the
workers, "Hey, smoke these."</i>

1025
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:28,012
<i>DuPonters did
as they were told.</i>

1026
00:55:28,014 --> 00:55:30,684
<i>Almost all those men
were hospitalized.</i>

1027
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:36,954
That's 1962,

1028
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:41,226
one year after Teflon launched,
and already DuPont knew.

1029
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:43,996
The dust, they just sent
right up the smokestacks,

1030
00:55:43,998 --> 00:55:45,998
released into the air.

1031
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,666
The sludge,
tossed it into the Ohio.

1032
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,335
<i>Or, uh, packed into drums</i>

1033
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:53,336
<i>and-and-and chucked it
into the Chesapeake.</i>

1034
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:56,041
<i>But then the drums
started washing up.</i>

1035
00:55:56,043 --> 00:55:57,307
<i>So DuPont starts</i>

1036
00:55:57,309 --> 00:56:00,846
digging ditches on the grounds
of the Washington Works plant.

1037
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:02,980
And in those pits, they dumped

1038
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:06,717
thousands of tons
of toxic C-8 sludge and dust.

1039
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,054
<i>One of the men that they hired
to dig those ditches</i>

1040
00:56:10,056 --> 00:56:13,057
<i>was Wilbur Tennant's
brother Jim.</i>

1041
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:16,128
But they weren't the only ones
covering their tracks.

1042
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:20,398
<i>3M, who-who pioneered
these chemicals for Scotchgard,</i>

1043
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,034
they were testing them
on monkeys.

1044
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:23,668
Most of the monkeys died.

1045
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,903
It wasn't like DuPont
didn't know that,

1046
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:29,940
<i>because they were doing
their own tests on rats.</i>

1047
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:32,978
<i>Watched their organs balloon.</i>

1048
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,211
Now the rats
are getting cancers.

1049
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:38,949
Tested them on pregnant rats
and watched them give birth

1050
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:41,353
to pups with deformed eyes.

1051
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:44,088
So they yanked
all the young women

1052
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,159
off the Teflon line,
never told them why.

1053
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:48,829
(medical monitor beeping)

1054
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:55,865
<i>Sue Bailey's job was scrubbing
these huge steel vats</i>

1055
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:57,735
<i>where they held the liquid C-8.</i>

1056
00:56:57,737 --> 00:56:59,003
<i>She was pregnant.</i>

1057
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:00,838
ROB:
I love you.

1058
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,340
SARAH (chuckles):
Would you stop?

1059
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:06,110
ROB:
<i>She gave birth to a baby</i>

1060
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:08,313
<i>with one nostril
and a deformed eye.</i>

1061
00:57:08,315 --> 00:57:12,286
<i>Remember how DuPont had seen
those deformities in the rats?</i>

1062
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:15,786
(whispers):
Oh, God.

1063
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:17,221
ROB:
What about his eyes?

1064
00:57:17,222 --> 00:57:19,324
- Blue, just like all newborns.
- (baby fussing)

1065
00:57:19,326 --> 00:57:21,460
But they're normal...
the lids, the-the pupils?

1066
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:24,128
- Mr. Bilott, relax.
- (baby crying)

1067
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,496
- He's perfect.
- (chuckles)

1068
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:26,797
Ah, hey.

1069
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,166
Hi, Charlie.

1070
00:57:28,168 --> 00:57:31,302
ROB:
<i>So Sue goes to DuPont.</i>

1071
00:57:31,304 --> 00:57:34,038
<i>She says, "Why did you
pull me off the Teflon line?</i>

1072
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:36,942
<i>Did C-8 make my baby this way?"</i>

1073
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:39,143
<i>"No," they tell her.</i>

1074
00:57:39,144 --> 00:57:43,248
<i>Then all of her records from
her time at Teflon disappear.</i>

1075
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:48,286
<i>One year later, they put
all of the women back on Teflon</i>

1076
00:57:48,288 --> 00:57:51,693
<i>and never say a thing.</i>

1077
00:57:57,163 --> 00:57:58,731
He's here.

1078
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,269
ROB:
<i>DuPont knew everything.</i>

1079
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:06,505
<i>They knew</i>

1080
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:09,206
that the C-8
they put into the air

1081
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,275
and buried into the ground
for decades

1082
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:13,110
was causing cancers.

1083
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,079
They knew that their own workers

1084
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:16,947
were getting these cancers.

1085
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:20,184
They knew that the consumers,
too, were being exposed.

1086
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:22,052
And not just in Teflon.

1087
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:25,356
In-in paints, in fabrics,

1088
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,027
in, uh, raincoats, boots.

1089
00:58:29,028 --> 00:58:31,298
To this day.

1090
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:34,298
ROB:
<i>For 40 years,</i>

1091
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,201
you knew C-8 was poison.

1092
00:58:37,202 --> 00:58:41,338
You knew the Happy Pan
was a ticking time bomb.

1093
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,875
And you knew exactly why.

1094
00:58:43,876 --> 00:58:46,478
Because C-8,
it stays in us forever.

1095
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,313
Our bodies are incapable
of breaking it down.

1096
00:58:49,315 --> 00:58:53,217
And knowing all of this,
still you did nothing,

1097
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:57,855
because doing something, quote,

1098
00:58:57,856 --> 00:59:00,925
"would essentially put
the long-term viability

1099
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:04,865
of this product segment
on the line," end quote.

1100
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:10,335
You were making too much money.

1101
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:15,039
$1 billion a year
just in profit, just in Teflon.

1102
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:19,043
And so you pumped
millions more pounds

1103
00:59:19,045 --> 00:59:22,380
of toxic C-8 into the air,
into the water,

1104
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:25,615
so much so you could
actually see it foam.

1105
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:27,853
C-8 was everywhere.

1106
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:32,059
There was nowhere left
for you to contaminate.

1107
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:38,262
And that's when
they came to Jim.

1108
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:40,599
They knew he was sick
and needed the money,

1109
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:42,900
and they needed his land.

1110
00:59:42,902 --> 00:59:46,269
And when they got it,
they dug up all the C-8

1111
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:49,173
from every single pit
at Washington Works...

1112
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:52,878
14 million pounds
of toxic C-8 sludge...

1113
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,478
and they dumped it again.

1114
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,181
This time right up there.

1115
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:59,483
Steps from your creek,
from your house.

1116
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:02,889
And that's what your cows
have been drinking, Earl.

1117
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:09,561
Put 'em behind bars.

1118
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:12,096
Whole damn lot of 'em,
rot in jail.

1119
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:14,431
I understand, believe me,
but th-this is a civil case.

1120
01:00:14,432 --> 01:00:16,634
The most we can hope for
is damages.

1121
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:18,503
Don't want no money!

1122
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,304
Whole damn world need...

1123
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:22,509
(coughing)

1124
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:28,179
...needs to see what they done.

1125
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:30,648
You're right. They should.

1126
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,286
And it... and it kills me
that they won't.

1127
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:37,288
But that would mean
going to trial

1128
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:39,958
and proving that C-8
killed your cows.

1129
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,626
And every scientist who knows
anything about any of this

1130
01:00:42,628 --> 01:00:44,929
already works
for these chemical companies.

1131
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:47,666
That's not an accident, Earl.

1132
01:00:47,668 --> 01:00:51,936
Earl, these... these companies,
they have all the money,

1133
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:54,139
all the time,
and they'll use it.

1134
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:57,509
Trust me, I know...
I was one of them.

1135
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,579
You're still one of 'em.

1136
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:03,181
(scoffs)

1137
01:01:03,182 --> 01:01:05,483
You-you can't be serious.

1138
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:08,018
You-you know what I put
on the line here?

1139
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,387
You want a prize?

1140
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:11,255
Some medal 'cause,
for once in your life,

1141
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:13,525
you took the side
of the little guy?

1142
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:15,226
Sorry, no prize.

1143
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:17,362
All you get is your share
of this blood money.

1144
01:01:17,364 --> 01:01:19,230
And you sleep
real good tonight.

1145
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,266
ROB:
Talk to your family.

1146
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:23,101
It ain't just my cows
that was poisoned.

1147
01:01:23,103 --> 01:01:25,570
What you think
I fed my family on?

1148
01:01:25,572 --> 01:01:28,172
Wilbur...

1149
01:01:28,173 --> 01:01:30,208
please!

1150
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,978
Leave this place!

1151
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,313
Start over!

1152
01:01:35,315 --> 01:01:37,581
Give your family
a fighting chance!

1153
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,619
Too late for that.

1154
01:01:42,456 --> 01:01:45,226
We got it, Sandra and me...
the cancer.

1155
01:01:46,592 --> 01:01:48,692
Surprise, surprise.

1156
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:50,697

SARAH:
In here.

1162
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:52,257
(cat meows)

1163
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:54,358
How'd it go?

1164
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,427
(Rob sighs)

1165
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:58,362
What's wrong?

1166
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:00,465
Rob?

1167
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:02,603
Rob, what is it?

1168
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:10,175
What happened? What happened?

1169
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:12,445
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

1170
01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:17,481
You saw a man hurting, and...
(sighs)

1171
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:19,650
...you did the Christian thing.

1172
01:03:19,652 --> 01:03:22,420
- You helped him.
- How?

1173
01:03:22,422 --> 01:03:25,289
How? How?
Either he dies penniless

1174
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:28,492
or he lets DuPont just keep
pillaging his community.

1175
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:30,431
How is that helping?

1176
01:03:33,798 --> 01:03:36,036
Got to get some sleep.

1177
01:03:46,378 --> 01:03:47,846
(Sarah scoffs)

1178
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:49,813
I can't believe
a freaking case settlement

1179
01:03:49,815 --> 01:03:51,518
could shut this up.

1180
01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:56,788
Have you read their
confidentiality agreements?

1181
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:00,257
You've uncovered
a threat to the public.

1182
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:02,726
This goes beyond lawyering.

1183
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:05,230
That's... (chuckles)
That's all I know is lawyering.

1184
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:07,431
Fine. Then be the lawyer.

1185
01:04:07,432 --> 01:04:09,300
You know DuPont
better than anyone.

1186
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:11,172
What haven't they thought of?

1187
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:14,641
(Sarah sighs)

1188
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,512
(start-up music plays)

1189
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:32,692
(clicks mouse)

1190
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:44,637
(tapping keys)

1191
01:05:09,762 --> 01:05:11,429
- (loud thud)
- (exhales sharply)

1192
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:12,963
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1193
01:05:12,965 --> 01:05:14,498
What is that?

1194
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,871
A memo and 136 exhibits.

1195
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:20,605

ROB: Wilbur, Sandra,
this is your copy.

1199
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:03,284
(cell phone chimes)

1200
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:14,391
ROB: <i>The EPA announced
a public hearing</i>

1201
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:17,394
into this family of chemicals
I've been looking into.

1202
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:18,862
I heard about it from Tucker.

1203
01:06:18,864 --> 01:06:20,965
- TOM: "Monsanto" Tucker?
- Union Carbide now.

1204
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:23,567
He says to me, "Is it true
that a Taft lawyer sent

1205
01:06:23,568 --> 01:06:25,369
"a phone book's worth of
confidential DuPont documents

1206
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:26,704
to the entire
federal government?"

1207
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:28,639
Internal documents,
not... not confidential.

1208
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:30,641
- Very different.
- So you're testifying.

1209
01:06:30,643 --> 01:06:32,909
I signed up to testify,
and the next thing I hear is

1210
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:35,045
DuPont has petitioned a judge

1211
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:37,547
to stop me from testifying,
from flying to D.C.,

1212
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:38,815
from even picking up
the phone...

1213
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:40,817
- They filed for a gag order.
- Yes.

1214
01:06:40,818 --> 01:06:42,887
- This is what we're up against.
- DAVID (laughing): Jesus.

1215
01:06:42,889 --> 01:06:44,454
- TOM: David.
- I mean, come on, Tom.

1216
01:06:44,456 --> 01:06:45,989
- What do you expect?
- Where do we stand?

1217
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,625
Well, the judge
rejected the gag order,

1218
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:49,626
so I fly out Monday.

1219
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:50,961
Nice.

1220
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:53,400
I guess we'll just
watch on C-SPAN.

1221
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You ever do anything
like this again,

1222
01:06:57,001 --> 01:07:00,704
I will cut your balls off and
serve them to DuPont myself.

1223
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,742
Now get out of here.

1224
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:07,644
Good luck in Washington.

1225
01:07:07,646 --> 01:07:09,846
Thanks, Tom.

1226
01:07:09,847 --> 01:07:15,452
ROB (on TV): This material, uh,
is a perfluoro, or a PFOA.

1227
01:07:15,454 --> 01:07:20,324
It's also known as FC-143,

1228
01:07:20,326 --> 01:07:23,728
ammonium perfluorooctanoate.

1229
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:28,465
It has been shown
by DuPont's own science

1230
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:32,670
that PFOA/C-8

1231
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:36,907
is possibly life-threatening
to human health.

1232
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:41,847
We are asking this agency
to do something.

1233
01:07:46,117 --> 01:07:48,320
¢Ü ¢Ü

1234
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,802
- ...presidential election in four decades.
- (door opens)

1235
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:07,704
Just look at these latest polls
this morning...

1236
01:08:07,706 --> 01:08:10,507
JOE: Did you forget to pay
the water bill?

1237
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:11,875
DARLENE:
What?

1238
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:14,878
You forget to pay
the water bill?

1239
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,979
No.

1240
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:19,117
We got a notice.

1241
01:08:19,118 --> 01:08:21,952
- (turns off TV)
- What's it say?

1242
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:26,390
Uh, "PFOA is a persistent
chemical that is slow

1243
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:28,524
"to be eliminated
from the bloodstream

1244
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:31,028
"of people who have been
exposed to it.

1245
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:34,865
"The DuPont Company has advised
the Lubeck water district

1246
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:37,033
"that low concentrations
have been found

1247
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,403
"in the district's wells.

1248
01:08:39,404 --> 01:08:41,005
"DuPont has advised the district

1249
01:08:41,006 --> 01:08:44,742
that it is confident
these levels are safe."

1250
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:46,943
What the hell does that mean?

1251
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:48,746
(Charlie fussing)

1252
01:08:48,747 --> 01:08:50,981
JOE:
A letter came last fall.

1253
01:08:50,984 --> 01:08:53,751
Made no sense to me,
so I started making calls.

1254
01:08:53,752 --> 01:08:56,118
DARLENE: I told Joe,
don't kick that hornet's nest.

1255
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:59,923
It's not like we didn't know
what we'd signed up for.

1256
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:02,193
What do you mean?

1257
01:09:02,194 --> 01:09:07,198
Oh, I was married before Joe,
um, to a chemist at DuPont.

1258
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,167
Dream job. Paid real well.

1259
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:10,801
And the perks.

1260
01:09:10,802 --> 01:09:12,502
Presents for no reason.

1261
01:09:12,503 --> 01:09:13,837
We'd get this catalog.

1262
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:16,474
Just pick whatever you want.

1263
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,073
And little stuff.

1264
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:21,444
Like he'd bring home this soap,
this miracle powder.

1265
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:23,648
You put it in the washing
machine or the dishwasher...

1266
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:25,783
just wipes stuff clean
like you would not believe.

1267
01:09:25,784 --> 01:09:28,885
One day,
he comes home and says,

1268
01:09:28,886 --> 01:09:30,886
"Can't bring
that stuff home no more."

1269
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:32,890
"Why?" Won't tell me.

1270
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:35,893
Then he'd get sick for weeks.

1271
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:38,127
The Teflon flu,
the guys would call it.

1272
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:41,231
We knew something wasn't right.

1273
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:44,600
But this house, we bought it

1274
01:09:44,603 --> 01:09:47,770
just by showing the bank
my husband's DuPont I.D.

1275
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:50,006
Put both our kids
through college.

1276
01:09:50,007 --> 01:09:52,542
Engineers.

1277
01:09:52,543 --> 01:09:55,680
In... in this town, that
doesn't come without a price.

1278
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:58,483
My brother Kenny
didn't know that price.

1279
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:00,551
He joined DuPont at 19.

1280
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:03,220
Died on the operating table
two years later.

1281
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:04,755
Ulcerative colitis.

1282
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:06,555
DARLENE:
Just like Dan Schiller had.

1283
01:10:06,557 --> 01:10:08,993
- Who-who's Dan?
- A chemist at DuPont.

1284
01:10:08,994 --> 01:10:11,528
Worked with my ex-husband.

1285
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:13,930
JOE:
And, uh, Roger, what's his name?

1286
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:15,533
DARLENE:
Wilkins, the foreman.

1287
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:16,899
JOE:
Steven Gellar.

1288
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,100
Randy Field.

1289
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:19,703
Randy's was kidney cancer.

1290
01:10:19,704 --> 01:10:21,572
- He survived.
- (sighs) Yeah, his wife didn't.

1291
01:10:21,573 --> 01:10:22,907
No, June's was thyroid.

1292
01:10:22,908 --> 01:10:24,707
And it was supposed
to be treatable.

1293
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,577
Hmm.
They didn't catch it in time.

1294
01:10:26,578 --> 01:10:30,046
But th-they caught it
in-in their son.

1295
01:10:30,047 --> 01:10:32,884
(stammering): Were your
children born, uh, healthy?

1296
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:35,086
- Yes. Yes, they were.
- Good.

1297
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:39,023
But... we wanted a third
and couldn't.

1298
01:10:39,024 --> 01:10:40,890
I went to my doctor.

1299
01:10:40,893 --> 01:10:42,126
He says,
"You need a hysterectomy.

1300
01:10:42,127 --> 01:10:43,529
You need it right away."

1301
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,296
I'm so sorry.

1302
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:49,233
Bad luck, I guess.

1303
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:52,269
I was 36.

1304
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,104
ROB:
Mr. Kiger, you...

1305
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:57,009
you think I could get
a copy of that letter?

1306
01:11:07,886 --> 01:11:10,587
What's wrong with your hand?

1307
01:11:10,588 --> 01:11:13,493
Nothing. It's fine.

1308
01:11:17,628 --> 01:11:19,662
- Whoa. Rob?
- (turn signal ticking)

1309
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:22,567
- (Sarah mutters)
- (Rob scoffs)

1310
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:23,936
- Rob, what are you doing?
- (tires squeal)

1311
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:27,939
I mean, it's not enough
to poison these people?

1312
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,106
- They got to swindle them, too?
- Okay, calm down.

1313
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:32,009
- All right?
- DuPont wrote that letter,

1314
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:33,944
not the water authority.

1315
01:11:33,945 --> 01:11:35,613
- How do you know that?
- You think I don't know

1316
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:37,881
what a DuPont letter
looks like by now?

1317
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:39,082
Okay. Okay.

1318
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,751
I mean, Jesus!

1319
01:11:40,752 --> 01:11:42,853
- It-it-it's evil, Sarah.
- (Charlie crying)

1320
01:11:42,854 --> 01:11:44,689
It's-it's fucking evil.

1321
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,823
What's "fack"?

1322
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:48,725
Perfect.

1323
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:50,827
It's nothing, sweetie.
It's nothing. Oh, boy.

1324
01:11:50,828 --> 01:11:51,895
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

1325
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,796
SARAH: Can you give Charlie
the bottle, please?

1326
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:56,198
- Where's his bottle?
- It's in the bag. Here.

1327
01:11:56,201 --> 01:11:57,667
What is all this?

1328
01:11:57,668 --> 01:11:58,903
ROB:
It's from Grammer's.

1329
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:01,972
- Left in her mailbox.
- (crying stops)

1330
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:03,274
SARAH: "Medical claims,
now and forever"?

1331
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:04,908
- ROB: Here, bud.
- SARAH: "Now and forever."

1332
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,144
Is that the... that...

1333
01:12:07,145 --> 01:12:10,279
Medical monitoring... is that...

1334
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:13,050
I thought you said
that wasn't gonna pass.

1335
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:15,086
¢Ü ¢Ü

1336
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:17,020
TOM:
Morning.

1337
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,622
DAVID:
Morning, guys.

1338
01:12:18,623 --> 01:12:20,725
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

1339
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:28,265
ROB: Our lead plaintiff
is Mr. Joe Kiger.

1340
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:31,268
Potential plaintiff,
if the partnership approves.

1341
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,938
Mr. Joe Kiger, a phys ed teacher

1342
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:36,207
from Parkersburg, West Virginia,

1343
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:40,676
on behalf of
the 70,000 local residents

1344
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:44,381
whose water DuPont knowingly
poisoned for the last 40 years.

1345
01:12:44,382 --> 01:12:46,917
- A class action?
- TOM: Let him finish.

1346
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:49,252
ROB:
The Kigers were notified

1347
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:52,921
by their local water company
that DuPont had found

1348
01:12:52,923 --> 01:12:56,426
small concentrations of C-8
in their water supply

1349
01:12:56,427 --> 01:13:01,698
but not to worry because
those concentrations were safe.

1350
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:02,899
Why?

1351
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,104
Because DuPont said so.

1352
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:11,242
This is what DuPont
considers safe.

1353
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:14,077
That's something like
one drop of water

1354
01:13:14,078 --> 01:13:16,279
in an Olympic-size
swimming pool.

1355
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,951
In other words, even a trace
of C-8 renders water unsafe.

1356
01:13:20,953 --> 01:13:24,822
But DuPont told the local
water authority, "Don't worry.

1357
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:26,756
Your wells have got
even less than that."

1358
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:28,893
- Except that was a lie.
- A lie?

1359
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:30,961
Yes. DuPont has been

1360
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:33,064
secretly testing
these wells for decades.

1361
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:36,033
They knew they had
contaminated those wells

1362
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:39,069
up to six times that level.

1363
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:41,404
And thanks to the Tennant case,
now we know, too.

1364
01:13:41,405 --> 01:13:44,408
Hold on. This stuff is
unregulated, right?

1365
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:46,310
I mean, I mean,
as far as EPA's concerned,

1366
01:13:46,311 --> 01:13:48,444
- it might as well be rose petals.
- Yeah.

1367
01:13:48,447 --> 01:13:52,048
The EPA hasn't set a standard...
that's true... but DuPont did.

1368
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:55,318
And all the law requires
to win a case like this

1369
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:57,720
is to show that DuPont exceeded

1370
01:13:57,722 --> 01:14:00,091
what DuPont itself
considers safe.

1371
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,425
Self-regulation.

1372
01:14:01,426 --> 01:14:03,060
PARTNER: If what
you're saying is right...

1373
01:14:03,061 --> 01:14:04,729
- It is right.
- ...then why would DuPont

1374
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,229
tell this water district
anything at all?

1375
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:10,935
Seems to me that they're being
a good corporate citizen here.

1376
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:14,037
That's how long you have
to file suit.

1377
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:16,238
One year from the moment
you realize

1378
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,509
your water's been contaminated.

1379
01:14:18,511 --> 01:14:20,510
This letter looks like

1380
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:22,813
it's telling people
their water is safe.

1381
01:14:22,814 --> 01:14:25,983
In fact, it's notifying them
that it isn't.

1382
01:14:25,984 --> 01:14:28,755
- DuPont has started the clock.
- DAVID: Smart.

1383
01:14:29,988 --> 01:14:31,488
We would've counseled that.

1384
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:33,457
ROB:
It was sent 11 months ago,

1385
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:36,024
the moment
they realized we knew.

1386
01:14:36,027 --> 01:14:38,328
In 30 days, they're home free.

1387
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:41,164
So that's the proposed case
in brief.

1388
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:42,932
But there's something else
to consider.

1389
01:14:42,935 --> 01:14:44,301
PARTNER 2:
You think?

1390
01:14:44,302 --> 01:14:46,069
- TOM: Rob.
- (quiet chuckle)

1391
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:49,006
C-8 bioaccumulates.
It builds up inside of us.

1392
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:52,243
Some class members
who aren't sick today

1393
01:14:52,244 --> 01:14:53,911
- will get sick tomorrow.
- (partners murmuring)

1394
01:14:53,912 --> 01:14:56,145
We need a way to protect them
into the future.

1395
01:14:56,148 --> 01:14:57,814
DAVID:
Jesus, Tom, if you're

1396
01:14:57,815 --> 01:14:59,314
even thinking about using
medical monitoring...

1397
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:01,484
- Hold on. Hold on.
- (partners murmuring)

1398
01:15:01,485 --> 01:15:04,054
Medical monitoring is a claim

1399
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:05,988
now permitted
in West Virginia courts.

1400
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:07,390
- PARTNER 2: Oh, come on.
- (others murmuring)

1401
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,957
Let's hear him out.

1402
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,295
It says, if a company
exposes a community

1403
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:13,130
to something
that makes them sick,

1404
01:15:13,131 --> 01:15:16,100
they must monitor the health of
that community indefinitely.

1405
01:15:16,101 --> 01:15:18,033
PARTNER 2:
Everybody get that?

1406
01:15:18,036 --> 01:15:20,336
You're creating liability
from mere exposure.

1407
01:15:20,337 --> 01:15:22,139
PARTNER:
It's also unprecedented.

1408
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,207
Exactly. Which is why,
not six months ago,

1409
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,975
- we fought tooth and nail against it.
- ROB: And you lost.

1410
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:30,814
Our-our clients have the right
to avail themselves of the law.

1411
01:15:30,815 --> 01:15:33,252
Potential clients.

1412
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,087
JAMES:
Uh, okay. Um...

1413
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,858
I-I-I know you, Rob.

1414
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:42,524
I-I-I know your passion.

1415
01:15:42,527 --> 01:15:45,395
Uh, you... you got a great
settlement for your farmer.

1416
01:15:45,396 --> 01:15:47,430
You should be proud of that.

1417
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:51,268
Uh, and perhaps as the newest
partner at this table,

1418
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,170
I should be more circumspect.

1419
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:56,606
But, uh,
what he's proposing here

1420
01:15:56,609 --> 01:16:00,144
is nothing less
than a-a shakedown

1421
01:16:00,145 --> 01:16:02,845
- of an iconic American company.
- We do not represent DuPont.

1422
01:16:02,847 --> 01:16:05,384
No, y-you don't
represent anyone.

1423
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:09,051
Is this what we have become?

1424
01:16:09,054 --> 01:16:11,087
Plaintiff's attorneys?
Ambulance chasers?

1425
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:12,622
I mean, why don't you
just admit it?

1426
01:16:12,623 --> 01:16:14,024
Rob, you want to flip.

1427
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:16,024
You want to take
everything that you know

1428
01:16:16,027 --> 01:16:18,229
about how
chemical companies operate

1429
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:21,097
and turn it against DuPont,
like an informant.

1430
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,298
- That's enough.
- Isn't that right?

1431
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,634
- TOM: Okay. (stammers)
- Isn't that right?

1432
01:16:23,636 --> 01:16:25,435
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1433
01:16:25,436 --> 01:16:28,972
Okay, then I-I say
we take a vote

1434
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:31,942
and determine whether or not
we continue

1435
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:33,943
in the tradition that has
distinguished this firm

1436
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:35,444
from everyone else
in the industry or...

1437
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:37,247
TOM:
Okay, I'm running this meeting.

1438
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:39,582
Okay? You got that?

1439
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,585
Has anyone even read

1440
01:16:41,587 --> 01:16:44,220
the evidence
this man has collected?

1441
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:47,490
The willful negligence,
the corruption?

1442
01:16:47,493 --> 01:16:49,560
Read it.

1443
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:52,060
And then tell me we should be
sitting on our asses.

1444
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:54,229
- (bangs table)
- That's the reason

1445
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:56,934
why Americans hate lawyers.

1446
01:16:56,935 --> 01:17:00,170
This is the crap that fuels
the Ralph Naders of the world.

1447
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:03,606
We should want to nail DuPont.

1448
01:17:03,609 --> 01:17:05,609
All of us should.

1449
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:08,176
American business is
better than this, gentlemen.

1450
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:11,180
And when it's not,
we should hold them to it.

1451
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:14,451
That's how you build faith
in the system.

1452
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:17,389
We're always arguing
that companies are people.

1453
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:20,256
Well, these people...

1454
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:22,426
have crossed the line!

1455
01:17:22,427 --> 01:17:24,463
To hell with them!

1456
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,198
HARRY:
It may come as a surprise

1457
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:32,368
to corporate defense types
like yourselves,

1458
01:17:32,369 --> 01:17:34,002
but there's more to the law

1459
01:17:34,005 --> 01:17:36,273
than just flooding
the other side in papers.

1460
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:39,643
From where I sit,
you have to touch people.

1461
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:42,211
You know, these girls,
they handle the calls

1462
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:44,515
from the class action members.

1463
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:47,184
And there's thousands of 'em
on any given case.

1464
01:17:47,185 --> 01:17:51,087
And it's here that we come
to know their pain.

1465
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:53,222
Isn't that right, Hazel?

1466
01:17:53,225 --> 01:17:54,457
Yes.

1467
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:57,193
We hear it every day,
and it's my job

1468
01:17:57,194 --> 01:17:59,127
to make a jury feel that pain,

1469
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:02,032
not out of pity,
but out of fear.

1470
01:18:02,033 --> 01:18:04,702
Whatever it is
that happened to my client,

1471
01:18:04,703 --> 01:18:09,273
that juror has to think,
"That could happen to me."

1472
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:10,673
ROB:
You just keep hammering it.

1473
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:13,042
One part per billion,
one part per billion.

1474
01:18:13,043 --> 01:18:15,211
It's their own documents,
their own scientists.

1475
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:16,680
- Absolutely.
- All right? They-they...

1476
01:18:16,681 --> 01:18:19,149
They set that standard.
They have to live with it.

1477
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:21,085
Yeah, I think
we can relax, Rob, though.

1478
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:22,586
(chuckling):
You know, there's no way

1479
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:24,654
they're gonna prevail
with a motion to dismiss.

1480
01:18:24,655 --> 01:18:26,421
This is procedural.

1481
01:18:26,423 --> 01:18:28,993
It's nonsense.
We'll get a trial today.

1482
01:18:30,328 --> 01:18:32,194
ROB: Okay, I'll catch
you guys in there.

1483
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:33,595
I'm gonna get a drink.

1484
01:18:33,597 --> 01:18:35,134
(water running)

1485
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:39,570
WILBUR:
I wouldn't drink that.

1486
01:18:41,506 --> 01:18:43,243
Earl.

1487
01:18:45,043 --> 01:18:47,042
How you doing?

1488
01:18:47,045 --> 01:18:49,712
Still here.

1489
01:18:49,713 --> 01:18:52,649
That's something, right?

1490
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,252
Yes, that-that's something.

1491
01:18:55,253 --> 01:18:56,722
It's good to see you, Rob.

1492
01:19:00,426 --> 01:19:02,725
Can't let 'em...

1493
01:19:02,726 --> 01:19:04,662
shut you down.

1494
01:19:06,463 --> 01:19:09,099
Oh, I-I won't. I-I promise.

1495
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,301
Whole world...

1496
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:14,439
needs to know.

1497
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,675
They will, Earl.

1498
01:19:18,676 --> 01:19:20,743
They will.

1499
01:19:20,744 --> 01:19:22,278
LARRY:
Hey, Rob.

1500
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:23,716
It's time.

1501
01:19:26,252 --> 01:19:28,587
I-I have to go.

1502
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:38,630
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

1503
01:19:42,368 --> 01:19:43,765
(gavel taps)

1504
01:19:43,768 --> 01:19:46,103
We are here
on defendant's motion

1505
01:19:46,104 --> 01:19:48,203
- to dismiss the case...
- Hey, Joe. How are you?

1506
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:51,573
...brought by Mr. Kiger, et al.

1507
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:53,109
- Now...
- (indistinct chatter)

1508
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,546
...which one of you
is Mr. Wallace?

1509
01:19:55,547 --> 01:19:58,215
Edward Wallace, Your Honor,
on behalf of

1510
01:19:58,216 --> 01:20:00,184
E.I. du Pont de Nemours
and Company,

1511
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:01,551
better known as DuPont.

1512
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:03,519
- Yes, I've heard of it.
- (light laughter)

1513
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,189
- Your motion.
- Thank you.

1514
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,423
Your Honor, we're here today

1515
01:20:07,426 --> 01:20:12,261
because of a uniquely American
invention: Teflon.

1516
01:20:12,262 --> 01:20:15,099
Since 1961, Teflon has
liberated housewives...

1517
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,201
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, uh, excuse me.

1518
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:18,469
Homemakers throughout...

1519
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,368
This is a courtroom,
Mr. Wallace,

1520
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:22,305
not the Home Shopping Network.

1521
01:20:22,306 --> 01:20:23,774
(laughter)

1522
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:26,310
Plaintiffs have alleged
that DuPont did not meet

1523
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:28,644
- its own standard of safety...
- She's good, huh? She's good.

1524
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:31,113
...with regard
to the level of C-8

1525
01:20:31,115 --> 01:20:33,182
- in the local water supply.
- HARRY: Okay.

1526
01:20:33,185 --> 01:20:34,783
That's irrelevant, Your Honor.

1527
01:20:34,786 --> 01:20:36,685
We ask you to dismiss
on grounds

1528
01:20:36,688 --> 01:20:38,654
that the only standard
that matters

1529
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:41,524
is the one that
elected government deems safe.

1530
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:43,594
- ROB: Not if it's unregulated.
- It's government's job

1531
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:45,761
to make these determinations,
not any one company.

1532
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:48,164
- That's a trap.
- They can't revert back to...

1533
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:49,365
I got it.

1534
01:20:49,368 --> 01:20:51,234
Is there a problem,
Mr. Deitzler?

1535
01:20:51,235 --> 01:20:54,569
Apologies, Your Honor,
but DuPont has been hiding

1536
01:20:54,572 --> 01:20:56,506
the dangers of this chemical

1537
01:20:56,507 --> 01:20:58,841
from the government
for a while now.

1538
01:20:58,842 --> 01:21:01,478
And they're asking you
to let 'em off the hook

1539
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:03,613
because they've succeeded
in their strategy.

1540
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:06,149
Government doesn't regulate C-8.

1541
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,317
WALLACE:
Uh, actually, that's not true.

1542
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:08,652
- Oh?
- No, no.

1543
01:21:08,654 --> 01:21:10,685
The West Virginia's
C-8 Working Group

1544
01:21:10,688 --> 01:21:12,555
has just issued a standard.

1545
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:14,224
Here with us today

1546
01:21:14,225 --> 01:21:16,225
is the governmental official
who led that effort,

1547
01:21:16,226 --> 01:21:17,796
Dr. Mary-Sue Kimball.

1548
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:20,796
(quiet murmuring)

1549
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,899
And, Dr. Kimball, uh,
as a senior member

1550
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,536
of the state's Department
of Environmental Protection,

1551
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:27,938
isn't it, in fact, your duty
to protect the citizens

1552
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:30,340
- of West Virginia...
- Mr. Wallace.

1553
01:21:30,341 --> 01:21:32,876
I'll cut to the chase.

1554
01:21:32,877 --> 01:21:35,578
What is the level of C-8
in drinking water

1555
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:36,947
that the state of West Virginia

1556
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:38,747
has determined to be
completely safe?

1557
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,850
- Watch it go from one part per billion to...
- Five? - Ten?

1558
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:42,920
150 parts per billion.

1559
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:45,889
- (gasping, murmuring)
- Welcome to West Virginia.

1560
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,358
WALLACE:
The levels found in the wells

1561
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:51,295
of all six water districts
represented in this suit,

1562
01:21:51,296 --> 01:21:53,296
do they fall below
this maximum level?

1563
01:21:53,297 --> 01:21:54,597
Well below.

1564
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,768
Nothing else, Your Honor.

1565
01:21:57,869 --> 01:21:59,868
Your witness, Mr. Deitzler.

1566
01:21:59,871 --> 01:22:01,537
Wait, who-who's on
the working group?

1567
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:02,639
DuPont, of course, and who else?

1568
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,307
- Who did the water testing?
- JUDGE: Mr. Deitzler?

1569
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,341
When was it done?

1570
01:22:05,344 --> 01:22:06,943
- One moment, Judge.
- What was the sample size?

1571
01:22:06,944 --> 01:22:08,743
Yeah, I mean,
we should be able to see...

1572
01:22:08,746 --> 01:22:10,747
- Going once.
- (indistinct conversation)

1573
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:12,515
JUDGE:
Going twice.

1574
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:16,286
Dr. Kimball, who were
the members of this cabal

1575
01:22:16,287 --> 01:22:17,886
you call the C-8 Working Group?

1576
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:19,921
WALLACE:
Objection.

1577
01:22:19,923 --> 01:22:22,626
Cool it, Mr. Deitzler.

1578
01:22:22,627 --> 01:22:24,728
Go ahead, Dr. Kimball.

1579
01:22:24,729 --> 01:22:26,496
Agency officials,

1580
01:22:26,497 --> 01:22:28,631
representatives of
the scientific community,

1581
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:29,966
um, stakeholders.

1582
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:31,969
Stakeholders?
Which stakeholders?

1583
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:35,470
Oh, wait, let me guess...
it rhymes with "bouffant."

1584
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:38,375
- (light laughter)
- DuPont is a stakeholder, yes.

1585
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:40,877
So, I see.
So, don't you find it peculiar

1586
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:43,947
that on the eve
of a class action lawsuit

1587
01:22:43,948 --> 01:22:47,618
where DuPont might be
considered liable

1588
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:50,252
for poisoning this community,

1589
01:22:50,255 --> 01:22:52,889
they get you
to come in here suddenly

1590
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:57,327
and reverse decades of their
so-called heralded science?

1591
01:22:57,328 --> 01:22:58,894
That's false.

1592
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:00,564
I don't work for DuPont.

1593
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:02,265
I didn't say you did.

1594
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:04,600
But now you bring it up,
we'll check back in a month.

1595
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:06,269
- Your Honor... No.
- Were you honestly gonna

1596
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,770
plan on telling this community

1597
01:23:07,771 --> 01:23:10,805
- that they can drink 150 times more C-8?
- (stammers)

1598
01:23:10,807 --> 01:23:12,809
I mean, come on, people,
bottoms up.

1599
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,810
- That kind of thing?
- Honestly, Judge, this is not...

1600
01:23:14,811 --> 01:23:16,747
All right,
Mr. Deitzler, enough.

1601
01:23:16,748 --> 01:23:18,814
KIMBALL: We'll be unveiling
the new standard

1602
01:23:18,815 --> 01:23:21,685
at an upcoming public hearing.

1603
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:24,621
"Unveiling."
Whoa, that sounds like a party.

1604
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:26,055
We'll be there!

1605
01:23:26,056 --> 01:23:28,261
(crowd clamoring)

1606
01:23:30,927 --> 01:23:32,863
HARRY:
Their safety standards thing,

1607
01:23:32,864 --> 01:23:34,863
that's all a sham.

1608
01:23:34,865 --> 01:23:38,502
Thanks to the judge's decision,
we will have our day in court.

1609
01:23:38,503 --> 01:23:40,037
- MAN: Yes, we will!
- (cheering)

1610
01:23:40,038 --> 01:23:42,506
Because, if the state
of West Virginia

1611
01:23:42,507 --> 01:23:44,372
won't stop
the DuPont corporation

1612
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:46,609
from literally poisoning
its citizens,

1613
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,680
then we the citizens
will stop them ourselves.

1614
01:23:49,681 --> 01:23:51,948
(crowd cheering)

1615
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:54,484
BARBARA WALTERS: Good evening,
and welcome to <i>20/20.</i>

1616
01:23:54,485 --> 01:23:57,086
Well, it coats the pots
you cook with

1617
01:23:57,087 --> 01:23:58,988
so the food doesn't stick,

1618
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:02,326
it protects the carpet
your baby crawls on...

1619
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:03,760
- I miss carpet.
- (shushing)

1620
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:05,060
WALTERS: ...winter jacket,
your skin lotion,

1621
01:24:05,063 --> 01:24:06,595
even your makeup.

1622
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:08,465
We're talking about Teflon.

1623
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:11,533
And tonight, our <i>20/20</i>
investigation uncovers

1624
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:15,738
alarming information
about this much-used material.

1625
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,939
It is very alarming, Barbara.
I cook with Teflon.

1626
01:24:17,942 --> 01:24:19,676
I didn't know until I watched

1627
01:24:19,677 --> 01:24:21,478
this report that
you're about to see

1628
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:23,380
that if Teflon
gets hot enough...

1629
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:24,847
...millions of people have
in their homes.

1630
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,615
Teflon has become
such a familiar...

1631
01:24:26,618 --> 01:24:27,984
...Teflon, a substance
that is also used

1632
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:29,853
in clothing and cars,
even in contact lenses.

1633
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:31,886
...already found in the blood
of most Americans.

1634
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:33,122
Now scientists are saying...

1635
01:24:33,123 --> 01:24:36,560
PFOA...
(continues in Korean)

1636
01:24:36,561 --> 01:24:37,827
...millions of homes
across Australia.

1637
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,595
Teflon, a nonstick surface...

1638
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:42,032
NEWSMAN: The Environmental
Protection Agency this morning

1639
01:24:42,033 --> 01:24:44,966
announced it has opened
a priority review

1640
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:47,703
of the chemical C-8,
currently the subject

1641
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:49,104
of a class action lawsuit

1642
01:24:49,106 --> 01:24:51,073
against the chemical giant
DuPont.

1643
01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:52,543
DARLENE:
Joe!

1644
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:55,412
Joe!

1645
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:57,479
Oh, my Lord, Joe, just wait!

1646
01:24:57,481 --> 01:25:00,515
Wait for the fire department,
please, honey!

1647
01:25:00,518 --> 01:25:02,051
- Please don't go crazy!
- (sirens blaring)

1648
01:25:02,052 --> 01:25:04,054
NEWSWOMAN:
<i>...have triggered a mass panic</i>

1649
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:05,421
<i>among Chinese consumers.</i>

1650
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:06,555
NEWSMAN 2:
<i>Should you throw away</i>

1651
01:25:06,557 --> 01:25:08,091
<i>your nonstick pans?
Many experts say...</i>

1652
01:25:08,092 --> 01:25:09,926
NEWSWOMAN 2:
<i>Are your pans making you sick?</i>

1653
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:11,560
<i>That's the question
being asked...</i>

1654
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:13,095
NEWSMAN 3: <i>...returns
of kitchen implements</i>

1655
01:25:13,096 --> 01:25:15,765
<i>coated in Teflon.</i>

1656
01:25:15,766 --> 01:25:18,801
JOE: The house was empty.
It belongs to my father.

1657
01:25:18,802 --> 01:25:20,871
I don't know how
it could've started.

1658
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:22,673
His name Kiger?

1659
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:26,912
Think someone might have
got the wrong house?

1660
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:33,018
(sighs)

1661
01:25:34,685 --> 01:25:38,755
WOMAN: All of this hullabaloo
is just silly.

1662
01:25:38,756 --> 01:25:41,925
Teflon is completely safe
for cooking.

1663
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:44,795
That is why we founded
the Cook Healthy campaign

1664
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:46,796
to set the record straight.

1665
01:25:46,797 --> 01:25:51,737
And besides being
completely safe, it is also...

1666
01:25:58,944 --> 01:26:00,746
Copy that.

1667
01:26:02,814 --> 01:26:04,817
All the way down.

1668
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:12,990
¢Ü ¢Ü

1669
01:26:21,097 --> 01:26:22,734

1670
01:26:33,212 --> 01:26:34,846
(engine shuts off)

1671
01:26:50,194 --> 01:26:52,197
¢Ü ¢Ü

1672
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,734
(car door closes)

1673
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:10,680
MAN:
We are now on the record.

1674
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:12,046
This is the videotaped
deposition

1675
01:27:12,048 --> 01:27:14,184
of Charles O. Holliday, Jr.,

1676
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:17,118
taken by the plaintiffs
in the matter of Kiger et al.

1677
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:20,189
versus E.I. du Pont de Nemours
and Company.

1678
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:22,225
Raise your right hand.

1679
01:27:22,226 --> 01:27:24,292
Do you swear to tell
the whole truth

1680
01:27:24,295 --> 01:27:25,895
and nothing but the truth?

1681
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:28,162
I do.

1682
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:30,867
ROB:
Uh, please state your name.

1683
01:27:30,868 --> 01:27:33,269
Charles O. Holliday, Jr.

1684
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:37,238
And are you presently employed?

1685
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,942
Yes.

1686
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:41,310
ROB:
What is your position?

1687
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:43,246
CHARLES: I'm the chairman
and chief executive officer

1688
01:27:43,247 --> 01:27:46,615
of the DuPont Company.

1689
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:48,283
In DuPont's most recent filing

1690
01:27:48,286 --> 01:27:51,121
with the Securities
and Exchange Commission,

1691
01:27:51,122 --> 01:27:53,122
you state, quote,

1692
01:27:53,123 --> 01:27:56,126
"Based on over 50 years
of industry experience

1693
01:27:56,127 --> 01:27:58,560
"and extensive scientific study,

1694
01:27:58,563 --> 01:28:00,729
"DuPont believes
there is no evidence

1695
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:04,899
"that PFOA causes any adverse
human health effects

1696
01:28:04,902 --> 01:28:07,002
or harms the environment."

1697
01:28:07,003 --> 01:28:08,671
You signed that legal filing,
correct?

1698
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:10,104
I don't recall
the exact statement,

1699
01:28:10,106 --> 01:28:12,108
but that sounds right to me.

1700
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:16,011
Are you aware that DuPont has,
in its own files,

1701
01:28:16,012 --> 01:28:18,715
studies dating back to the 1970s

1702
01:28:18,716 --> 01:28:21,149
that say just the opposite?

1703
01:28:21,152 --> 01:28:24,354
That PFOA...
or C-8, as it's called...

1704
01:28:24,355 --> 01:28:26,220
has potentially
life-threatening effects

1705
01:28:26,222 --> 01:28:27,756
on human health?

1706
01:28:27,757 --> 01:28:29,626
I'm not familiar
with the exact studies

1707
01:28:29,627 --> 01:28:30,993
we may have in our files.

1708
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:32,328
Then I'll take you through them.

1709
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:34,565
Uh, exhibit nine.

1710
01:28:39,003 --> 01:28:43,037
Uh, y-you were just handed
exhibit nine.

1711
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,309
Uh, you see the date
March 13, 1979?

1712
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:48,743
- Yes.
- You see the DuPont logo at the top?

1713
01:28:48,746 --> 01:28:50,180
Yes.

1714
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:53,617
- ROB: Do you see this word here highlighted?
- Yes.

1715
01:28:53,618 --> 01:28:55,149
ROB: Would you read it
for me, please?

1716
01:28:55,152 --> 01:28:56,786
CHARLES:
"Receptors."

1717
01:28:56,787 --> 01:29:01,323
Do you know what that word
refers to... "receptors"?

1718
01:29:01,324 --> 01:29:04,327
Um, in this context, I do not.

1719
01:29:04,328 --> 01:29:06,363
It means human beings.

1720
01:29:06,364 --> 01:29:08,832
DuPont refers
to the men and women

1721
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:12,368
that your company exposed
to C-8 as "receptors."

1722
01:29:12,369 --> 01:29:17,640
And in these receptors,
your scientists found, quote,

1723
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:21,411
"significantly higher incidents
of allergic endocrine

1724
01:29:21,412 --> 01:29:23,880
and metabolic disorders,"
end quote.

1725
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:25,680
As well as, quote,

1726
01:29:25,682 --> 01:29:28,385
"excess risk of developing
liver disease."

1727
01:29:28,386 --> 01:29:30,590
- Do you see that?
- Yes.

1728
01:29:32,056 --> 01:29:36,158
Moreover, you have
infertility at Teflon.

1729
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,127
Occurrences of leukemia.

1730
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:40,430
You have excess of cancers.

1731
01:29:40,431 --> 01:29:42,231
Bladder, kidney, oral, pharynx.

1732
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:43,233
Next paragraph.

1733
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:45,135

You see that date?
Do you see that?

1736
01:29:47,837 --> 01:29:50,340
Exhibit 96. Exhibit 53.

1737
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:52,676
I'd like to move on
to birth defects.

1738
01:29:52,677 --> 01:29:54,443
- We've gone almost seven hours.
- ROB: Mr. Holliday,

1739
01:29:54,444 --> 01:29:56,779
you're aware that, in 1981,

1740
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:00,448
3M notified DuPont that it had
conducted studies on rats

1741
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:03,819
and these studies showed
that sustained C-8 exposure

1742
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,822
can cause facial deformities?

1743
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:07,957
I'm not aware of a study by 3M.

1744
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,390
How about DuPont's own studies

1745
01:30:09,393 --> 01:30:12,329
that showed the same thing
in humans?

1746
01:30:15,734 --> 01:30:18,966
That's DuPont's
pregnancy study from 1981.

1747
01:30:18,969 --> 01:30:20,868
Does that look like
a DuPont document to you?

1748
01:30:20,871 --> 01:30:22,407
It looks to be.

1749
01:30:24,141 --> 01:30:26,140
Are you aware
that DuPont has denied

1750
01:30:26,143 --> 01:30:30,015
that any such study
ever even took place?

1751
01:30:31,347 --> 01:30:33,149
I'm not familiar
with specific statements

1752
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:34,751
we've made about that.

1753
01:30:34,752 --> 01:30:36,752
Seven pregnant women,

1754
01:30:36,753 --> 01:30:40,988
all DuPont employees,
all from the Teflon line.

1755
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:43,359
Do you see this here?

1756
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,296
Quote, "Child, four months,

1757
01:30:46,297 --> 01:30:49,198
one nostril, eye defect,"
end quote.

1758
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,265
- Yes.
- Two of the seven women,

1759
01:30:51,268 --> 01:30:54,037
nearly 30%,
gave birth to babies

1760
01:30:54,038 --> 01:30:56,337
that had the exact
facial deformities

1761
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,408
that your company
already knew about.

1762
01:30:58,409 --> 01:31:00,011
We're done here.

1763
01:31:01,444 --> 01:31:03,947
Sir.

1764
01:31:03,948 --> 01:31:06,284
His parents named him Bucky.

1765
01:31:09,854 --> 01:31:11,423
Bucky Bailey.

1766
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:15,460
This is your receptor.

1767
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:25,470
Now we're done.

NEWSMAN: <i>The Environmental

<i>used in the manufacture

1784

<i>DuPont will pay the EPA

MEDIATOR: To recap,
we've agreed that DuPont

1788
01:33:36,634 --> 01:33:39,100
will clean
local water supplies,

1789
01:33:39,103 --> 01:33:43,404
install infiltration systems
in all six water districts.

1790
01:33:43,407 --> 01:33:45,439
Additionally, DuPont will pay

1791
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:47,510
$70 million in cash
to the class.

1792
01:33:47,511 --> 01:33:49,679
Three days' revenue
on the Teflon line.

1793
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,447
- (light scoffing)
- MEDIATOR: Which leaves

1794
01:33:51,448 --> 01:33:54,951
our most challenging issue:
medical monitoring.

1795
01:33:54,953 --> 01:33:58,185
We've agreed to establish
an independent science panel

1796
01:33:58,188 --> 01:34:00,055
comprised of three scientists

1797
01:34:00,056 --> 01:34:03,158
who have no relationship
to either side.

1798
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:07,029
This independent panel will
study the members of this class

1799
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,231
to determine
whether C-8 exposure

1800
01:34:09,234 --> 01:34:13,100
has led to increased incidents
of disease in this region.

1801
01:34:13,103 --> 01:34:16,404
If the panel finds that there
are probable scientific links

1802
01:34:16,407 --> 01:34:18,408
to a particular disease,

1803
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:21,077
the health of everyone
in the class will be monitored

1804
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:23,645
for that disease in perpetuity

1805
01:34:23,646 --> 01:34:27,350
at DuPont's cost
up to $235 million.

1806
01:34:27,351 --> 01:34:30,353
And any class member
who develops that disease

1807
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:33,421
can sue DuPont for damages.

1808
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:36,626
However, if the science panel

1809
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:40,430
fails to establish
probable scientific links,

1810
01:34:40,431 --> 01:34:41,997
then this case is over.

1811
01:34:41,998 --> 01:34:45,368
No monitoring, no lawsuits,
no exceptions.

1812
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:46,600
Good.

1813
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:48,171
Well, gentlemen,
you are now officially

1814
01:34:48,172 --> 01:34:50,506
in the hands of science.

1815

HARRY:
<i>Well... (sighs)</i>

1816
01:34:52,509 --> 01:34:55,577

ROB:
It's festive.

1818
01:34:57,247 --> 01:34:58,747
HARRY: Wouldn't have
pegged you for that, either.

1819
01:34:58,748 --> 01:35:00,615
ROB:
We have something to celebrate.

1820
01:35:00,618 --> 01:35:03,586
- HARRY: Yeah?
- LARRY: Do we?

1821
01:35:03,587 --> 01:35:08,055
Look, how do we know that
the panel is going to prove

1822
01:35:08,057 --> 01:35:10,993
that DuPont made
all these people sick?

1823
01:35:10,994 --> 01:35:13,662
I'm no scientist,
but even I know you'd need

1824
01:35:13,663 --> 01:35:15,529
huge amounts of medical data,

1825
01:35:15,532 --> 01:35:18,466
not to mention thousands
of blood samples and...

1826
01:35:18,469 --> 01:35:21,069
HARRY:
From people who don't trust us.

1827
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:23,139
"Hey, folks, we want to
stick you with some needles.

1828
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:24,474
You won't mind, will you?"

1829
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:28,176

I mean, I know these people.

1830
01:35:28,177 --> 01:35:30,278
They're gonna
take the money and run.

1831
01:35:30,279 --> 01:35:32,279
Wouldn't you?

1832
01:35:32,282 --> 01:35:34,649
I think they-they want more
than just the money.

1833
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,452
I-I-I-I think they...

1834
01:35:37,453 --> 01:35:40,390
they want to know if they're
gonna get sick or not.

1835
01:35:40,391 --> 01:35:42,358
Or if they have C-8
in their blood

1836
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:45,359
and what that's gonna do
t-to them and their families.

1837
01:35:45,362 --> 01:35:49,798
So, we're just gonna trust
that they show up, huh?

1838
01:35:49,801 --> 01:35:52,033
ROB:
Trust and... but verify.

1839
01:35:52,036 --> 01:35:53,503
What does that mean, Rob?

1840
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:57,640
Well, come in for an exam.

1841
01:35:57,641 --> 01:36:01,443
Um... give us a blood sample.

1842
01:36:01,444 --> 01:36:04,148
Then we'll give you your check.

1843

They're gonna be making you
partner this year.

1890
01:38:04,902 --> 01:38:06,301
- I know it.
- Well, they'd better.

1891
01:38:06,302 --> 01:38:07,435
- I mean...
- (phone ringing)

1892
01:38:07,436 --> 01:38:08,738
SILAS:
Mommy, come see this!

1893
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:10,305
Hey, baby,
did you hang that ornament?

1894
01:38:10,306 --> 01:38:11,805
- SARAH: Rob, can you get that?
- ROB: Mm, uh...

1895
01:38:11,807 --> 01:38:13,643
- KARLA: Let me see.
- ROB: Okay, I'm-I'm coming.

1896
01:38:13,645 --> 01:38:15,646
(phone continues ringing)

1897
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:18,447
Hello?

1898
01:38:18,448 --> 01:38:19,814
LARRY:
Rob, you sitting down for this?

1899
01:38:19,815 --> 01:38:22,783
- Larry, what's wrong?
- 69,000.

1900
01:38:22,786 --> 01:38:24,487
69,000 what?

1901
01:38:24,488 --> 01:38:27,590
69,000 people got tested.
69,000!

1902
01:38:27,591 --> 01:38:29,759
You realize
how much data this is?

1903
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:31,661
This is what we needed, Rob.
This is it.

1904
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:33,962
- Oh, my God.
- You were right all along, my friend.

1905
01:38:33,963 --> 01:38:35,363
- Merry Christmas.
- (chuckling): Thank you.

1906
01:38:35,364 --> 01:38:36,698
- You bet.
- Thank you!

1907
01:38:36,699 --> 01:38:38,402
LARRY:
Talk real soon.

1908
01:38:40,203 --> 01:38:41,871
- Hey, who was that?
- You won't believe.

1909
01:38:41,872 --> 01:38:43,738
- TONY: Daddy, guess what I just did.
- Yeah?

1910
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:46,576
- What? What'd you just do?
- I put the angel on the top.

1911
01:38:46,578 --> 01:38:48,344
- Yeah?
- Uncle Ben lifted me.

1912
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:49,644
He did? Like this?

1913
01:38:49,645 --> 01:38:50,912
(grunts)

1914
01:38:50,913 --> 01:38:52,881
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1915
01:38:52,882 --> 01:38:54,918
OTHERS:
Merry Christmas!

1916
01:39:09,632 --> 01:39:10,865
We are gathered here today

1917
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:14,703
in memory
of Wilbur Earl Tennant.

1918
01:39:14,704 --> 01:39:17,707
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

1919
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,743
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

1920
01:39:20,744 --> 01:39:23,712
He leads me beside still waters.

1921
01:39:23,713 --> 01:39:25,779
He restoreth my soul.

1922
01:39:25,782 --> 01:39:29,752
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1923
01:39:29,753 --> 01:39:32,354
I will fear no evil...

1924
01:39:32,355 --> 01:39:34,359
¢Ü ¢Ü

1925
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,412
¢Ü ¢Ü

1926
01:40:04,554 --> 01:40:06,287
TEDDY: Quick, everybody.
Mustard or ketchup?

1927
01:40:06,289 --> 01:40:08,323
CHARLIE: Teddy, for the
tenth time, that's my ketchup.

1928
01:40:08,324 --> 01:40:09,859
SARAH:
Charlie, don't start.

1929
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,661
CHARLIE:
What? It's mine. I got it.

1930
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:14,363
- He's got his own, okay?
- MAN: You're that lawyer.

1931
01:40:14,364 --> 01:40:15,867
Finish up.

1932
01:40:17,067 --> 01:40:19,033
My brother's Dale Lamb.

1933
01:40:19,036 --> 01:40:21,336
You took his blood,
said you'd help him.

1934
01:40:21,337 --> 01:40:23,072
Yeah, I did.
We're-we're-we're...

1935
01:40:23,073 --> 01:40:24,573
we're working on that.
I promise.

1936
01:40:24,574 --> 01:40:27,408
He's dead. (sniffs)

1937
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:29,346
Testicular cancer.

1938
01:40:30,747 --> 01:40:33,717
Left three little boys
younger than yours.

1939
01:40:38,922 --> 01:40:41,292
But you enjoy your family.

1940
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:45,661
- Okay. Everybody up.
- I'm not finished.

1941
01:40:45,662 --> 01:40:47,398
I said up.

1942
01:40:51,435 --> 01:40:53,438
¢Ü ¢Ü

1943
01:41:04,381 --> 01:41:06,384
¢Ü ¢Ü

1944
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,895
(door opens, closes)

1945
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:24,402
(sobs softly)

1946
01:41:25,802 --> 01:41:27,403
Well, Darlene can't even
leave the house

1947
01:41:27,404 --> 01:41:29,037
without being harassed.

1948
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:30,773
ROB (over phone):
I-I know, Joe. I'm...

1949
01:41:30,774 --> 01:41:33,908
First, they-they blame us
for suing DuPont,

1950
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:35,609
and now they hate on us

1951
01:41:35,612 --> 01:41:37,747
'cause they ain't seen
nothing from it.

1952
01:41:37,748 --> 01:41:40,850
- ROB: I'm sorry, Joe.
- Well, that ain't good enough!

1953
01:41:40,851 --> 01:41:44,720
And they wonder why in the hell
it takes four damn years

1954
01:41:44,721 --> 01:41:48,390
to read a lousy blood sample,
and I don't blame 'em.

1955
01:41:48,391 --> 01:41:50,426
We trusted you, Rob.

1956
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:52,493
We put our faith in you.

1957
01:41:52,496 --> 01:41:54,430
- I know, Joe. I'm-I'm so...
- All right?

1958
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:56,435
- I'm so...
- (click, dial tone)

1959
01:41:59,069 --> 01:42:02,837
ROB: <i>Isn't there just...
just some kind of a...</i>

1960
01:42:02,838 --> 01:42:04,907
a progress report,
anything that I can...

1961
01:42:04,908 --> 01:42:06,942
I can share with these folks?

1962
01:42:06,944 --> 01:42:09,778
I mean, they-they...
they have been waiting.

1963
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:11,447
WOMAN (over phone):
I'm sorry, Mr. Bilott.

1964
01:42:11,448 --> 01:42:13,046
The panel is still
in the process

1965
01:42:13,048 --> 01:42:15,050
of analyzing complex data
and modeling

1966
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:17,551
from thousands of samples
and medical histories.

1967
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:19,121
(sighs)
I'm so sorry.

1968
01:42:19,122 --> 01:42:21,157
Could you hold a moment?

1969
01:42:21,158 --> 01:42:23,027
(Rob sighs)

1970
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,033
(utensils clinking on dishes)

1971
01:42:31,034 --> 01:42:33,372
SARAH: Charlie,
don't pick at your food.

1972
01:42:34,805 --> 01:42:36,539
What's a hooker?

1973
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:39,942
Where did you learn that?

1974
01:42:39,944 --> 01:42:42,980
He told me that
Mary Magdalene was a hooker.

1975
01:42:44,748 --> 01:42:46,015
What? She was.

1976
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:48,082
You're supposed to say
"prostitute."

1977
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:50,452
SARAH:
And then she found God

1978
01:42:50,453 --> 01:42:54,222
and became one of Jesus's
most fervent disciples.

1979
01:42:54,225 --> 01:42:56,524
See? I was just
teaching him the Bible.

1980
01:42:56,525 --> 01:42:57,859
I-I can't today.

1981
01:42:57,860 --> 01:42:59,595
So, everybody up.

1982
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:01,766
- (indistinct whispering)
- SARAH: Everybody up.

1983
01:43:06,069 --> 01:43:08,103
(Tony groans)

1984
01:43:08,104 --> 01:43:09,505
(boys chattering indistinctly)

1985
01:43:09,506 --> 01:43:11,506
Can we still afford it?

1986
01:43:11,507 --> 01:43:13,108
What?

1987
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:14,880
Catholic school.

1988
01:43:30,127 --> 01:43:32,829
My brother's back in rehab.
Did you know that?

1989
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,601
- No. I'm sorry.
- Today's...

1990
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:43,572
Today's Mom's first day
at chemo.

1991
01:43:43,573 --> 01:43:45,106
I forgot.

1992
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:47,274
'Cause it's not
about your case, Rob.

1993
01:43:47,277 --> 01:43:48,676
Car!

1994
01:43:48,677 --> 01:43:50,179
- Gosh.
- Okay. Geez.

1995
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:53,046
- (door opens)
- (Sarah sighs)

1996
01:43:53,048 --> 01:43:55,885
(boys chattering indistinctly)

1997
01:43:55,886 --> 01:43:59,255
Teddy forged my signature,
and Tony's quitting football.

1998
01:43:59,256 --> 01:44:01,890
Tony. But how would you know
about that, right?

1999
01:44:01,891 --> 01:44:04,658
Because all you see,
all that you-you...

2000
01:44:04,661 --> 01:44:07,761
the boys have ever seen
is you obsessing about this...

2001
01:44:07,764 --> 01:44:09,132
(sighs)

2002
01:44:11,768 --> 01:44:13,770
Have I ever complained?

2003
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,576
Say something,
for God's sakes, Rob.

2004
01:44:20,578 --> 01:44:22,042
No.

2005
01:44:22,045 --> 01:44:23,746
- No?
- No.

2006
01:44:23,747 --> 01:44:25,180
No.

2007
01:44:25,181 --> 01:44:26,948
Because I knew
that you needed something.

2008
01:44:26,949 --> 01:44:30,219
Uh, some connection,
s-something.

2009
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:33,023
And s... so I took it on.

2010
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,591
But if you want
to start accounting,

2011
01:44:36,592 --> 01:44:40,264
if you want to start with-with,
"Oh, can we afford," then...

2012
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,332
I don't know, Rob.

2013
01:44:45,335 --> 01:44:47,301
Can the boys afford a father

2014
01:44:47,304 --> 01:44:49,203
who can't string
two words together?

2015
01:44:49,204 --> 01:44:51,305
Can our marriage afford
13 years of...

2016
01:44:51,307 --> 01:44:53,676
13 years of this?

2017
01:44:55,779 --> 01:44:58,145
How about it, Rob?
You want to talk about it?

2018
01:44:58,148 --> 01:45:00,150
About our lives?

2019
01:45:03,953 --> 01:45:06,822
Of course not.

2020
01:45:06,823 --> 01:45:09,060
I'll tell Mom
you asked about her.

2021
01:45:12,228 --> 01:45:14,127
TOM: <i>What in God's name
is that panel doing?</i>

2022
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,729
<i>And wh-why are we still
getting bills?</i>

2023
01:45:15,731 --> 01:45:19,134
Overhead, uh... (scoffs)
local counsel.

2024
01:45:19,136 --> 01:45:20,801
H-Harry's call center.

2025
01:45:20,804 --> 01:45:22,237
A thousand dollars an hour.

2026
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:24,006
That-that was a...
that was a technical expert.

2027
01:45:24,007 --> 01:45:26,609
We needed to do fi-filings

2028
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,943
when DuPont started lobbying
Washington to keep C-8...

2029
01:45:28,944 --> 01:45:30,278
That's Washington's problem,
not ours.

2030
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:32,145
That's why you got them
involved. Your memo.

2031
01:45:32,148 --> 01:45:34,048
It was just a fine, Tom.
It's a fine.

2032
01:45:34,051 --> 01:45:35,384
(chuckling):
$16 million, it's...

2033
01:45:35,386 --> 01:45:37,118
it's nothing for these people.

2034
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,020
- It's pocket change.
- Yes, but if they get charged

2035
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:40,354
with criminal concealment,
game over.

2036
01:45:40,356 --> 01:45:41,890
You said DOJ was investigating.

2037
01:45:41,891 --> 01:45:43,759
- Not anymore.
- What?

2038
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:45,193
They dropped the investigation.

2039
01:45:45,194 --> 01:45:46,761
- They dropped... What?
- They dropped it.

2040
01:45:46,762 --> 01:45:47,965
No reason given.

2041
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:54,836
Tom, our-our government
is captive to DuPont.

2042
01:45:54,837 --> 01:45:57,238
This case,
it's the only hope we have.

2043
01:45:57,239 --> 01:45:59,742
They know that,
and they're trying to make it

2044
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:03,247
as expensive as they can
to force you to make me stop.

2045
01:46:05,114 --> 01:46:07,283
- Just tell me how much longer.
- Uh...

2046
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:09,385
I-I-I ca... I can't.

2047
01:46:09,386 --> 01:46:12,787
I-I-I-I wish I could.

2048
01:46:12,788 --> 01:46:14,856
- Tom, I...
- Are you okay?

2049
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:16,358
Uh, I'm fine. I'm just...

2050
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:19,359
Rob, I'm a managing partner now.

2051
01:46:19,362 --> 01:46:21,895
- I have a firm to run.
- I know.

2052
01:46:21,898 --> 01:46:23,399
And, Tom,
I think there could be

2053
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,067
a huge payout here if we can...

2054
01:46:25,069 --> 01:46:26,734
You think I'm in this for money?

2055
01:46:26,735 --> 01:46:28,671
- No, I...
- You think I am...

2056
01:46:28,672 --> 01:46:30,404
I'm-I'm letting you drag

2057
01:46:30,407 --> 01:46:32,841
this firm's reputation
through a meat grinder

2058
01:46:32,842 --> 01:46:34,877
for some kind of
plaintiff's payoff?

2059
01:46:34,878 --> 01:46:36,944
¢Ü ¢Ü

2060
01:46:36,945 --> 01:46:39,180
(echoing): I-I don't know why
you're doing... doing it.

2061
01:46:39,181 --> 01:46:41,953
(Tom sighs)

2062
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:46,154
(faint, distorted):
Rob, listen, I...

2063
01:46:46,155 --> 01:46:48,756
I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to take another pay cut.

2064
01:46:48,757 --> 01:46:50,359
ROB: Tom, that's-that's
my fourth pay cut.

2065
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:52,193
- What am I supposed to do?
- I-I-I...

2066
01:46:52,194 --> 01:46:53,729
TOM:
You-you don't have any...

2067
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,264
ROB:
I'm-I'm down to a third now.

2068
01:46:55,265 --> 01:46:56,363
You don't have any clients.
You-you...

2069
01:46:56,365 --> 01:46:57,667
No one will take your calls.

2070
01:46:59,235 --> 01:47:01,069
What am I supposed to do here?

2071
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:03,872
Now, I'm on your side, but...

2072
01:47:03,873 --> 01:47:06,207
Rob? Emmy!

2073
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:08,210
Hey! Emmy!

2074
01:47:08,212 --> 01:47:10,877
- EMMY: Kathleen! Kathleen!
- TOM: Get some help!

2075
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,282
- TOM: Get some help!
- Rob?

2076
01:47:13,283 --> 01:47:14,881
Rob?

2077
01:47:14,884 --> 01:47:18,255
(machine buzzing loudly)

2078
01:47:23,993 --> 01:47:25,728
TOM:
Looks like we should, uh,

2079
01:47:25,729 --> 01:47:29,465
cancel my 4:00
with Jerry and...

2080
01:47:29,466 --> 01:47:31,432
I don't know. We're waiting.

2081
01:47:31,435 --> 01:47:33,836
But, uh, give us, uh...

2082
01:47:33,837 --> 01:47:36,770
Well, uh, uh...

2083
01:47:36,773 --> 01:47:40,509
Make-make sure that, uh,
Jerry knows that, um...

2084
01:47:40,511 --> 01:47:42,810
I-I have to go.

2085
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:44,880
- Mrs. Bilott?
- Yes.

2086
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:48,015
We think your husband's
most likely experienced a TIA,

2087
01:47:48,016 --> 01:47:50,385
a transient ischemic attack.

2088
01:47:50,386 --> 01:47:52,787
Blood is briefly cut off
to the brain,

2089
01:47:52,788 --> 01:47:54,993
mimicking the symptoms
of a stroke.

2090
01:47:56,359 --> 01:47:58,426
Uh, uh, excuse me. A TIA?

2091
01:47:58,427 --> 01:48:00,362
This wasn't short.

2092
01:48:00,363 --> 01:48:02,863
It-it kept going on.

2093
01:48:02,865 --> 01:48:04,399
What about poison?

2094
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,399
I'm sorry?

2095
01:48:06,402 --> 01:48:08,836
(quietly): Could someone be...
be poisoning him?

2096
01:48:08,837 --> 01:48:10,837
No, Mrs. Bilott.

2097
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,841
This is neurological.

2098
01:48:12,842 --> 01:48:14,877
You just said
it wasn't a stroke.

2099
01:48:14,878 --> 01:48:16,845
(sighs)
Not this time.

2100
01:48:16,846 --> 01:48:18,380
- What does that mean?
- Well, it means that

2101
01:48:18,381 --> 01:48:20,414
he needs to never miss
his medication

2102
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:24,318
and he needs to reduce all
sources of stress in his life.

2103
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:26,421
He's under
enormous pressure at work.

2104
01:48:26,422 --> 01:48:28,555
Well, that needs to change.

2105
01:48:28,557 --> 01:48:30,259
But he's a young man.

2106
01:48:30,261 --> 01:48:32,961
He shouldn't be having
these incidences.

2107
01:48:32,962 --> 01:48:34,930
He's sedated,
but you can see him.

2108
01:48:34,931 --> 01:48:36,930
- Okay.
- I'll check in on him tomorrow.

2109
01:48:36,932 --> 01:48:38,868
Thank you. Thank you.

2110
01:48:42,905 --> 01:48:44,743
TOM:
Um...

2111
01:48:45,942 --> 01:48:48,844
I'll, uh, give you some privacy.

2112
01:48:48,845 --> 01:48:50,845
Uh...

2113
01:48:50,846 --> 01:48:54,051
anything you need, call me.

2114
01:48:56,587 --> 01:48:59,423
I need you to stop making him
feel like a failure.

2115
01:49:05,895 --> 01:49:07,863
I appreciate the stress

2116
01:49:07,864 --> 01:49:10,198
that your family
must be going through.

2117
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:11,966
Please...

2118
01:49:11,967 --> 01:49:14,137
don't talk to me
like I'm the wife.

2119
01:49:17,172 --> 01:49:21,443
Did Rob ever tell you about,
uh, moving around as a kid?

2120
01:49:21,444 --> 01:49:23,144
Um, I, uh...

2121
01:49:23,145 --> 01:49:25,212
Ten times before senior year.

2122
01:49:25,215 --> 01:49:27,983
No friends, no ties, no...

2123
01:49:27,984 --> 01:49:31,854
Just him, his sister,
his folks and...

2124
01:49:31,855 --> 01:49:35,126
Then I came along,
and you came along and, uh...

2125
01:49:37,025 --> 01:49:39,493
Taft... it's not just a job.

2126
01:49:39,494 --> 01:49:41,595
To him, it's...

2127
01:49:41,597 --> 01:49:43,801
it's home.

2128
01:49:45,902 --> 01:49:49,069
And he was willing
to risk all that

2129
01:49:49,072 --> 01:49:53,108
for a stranger
who needed his help.

2130
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:58,248
Now, you and I may not know
what that is...

2131
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:02,252
...but it's not failure.

01:51:52,261 --> 01:51:54,231
Sorry, my radio's busted.

2151
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:57,631
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

2152
01:51:57,632 --> 01:51:59,167
It'll be a surprise.

Hey, Rob. Bill Leary.

01:53:47,643 --> 01:53:49,176
Uh, we haven't met.

2166
01:53:49,177 --> 01:53:51,179
I'm the new comptroller
out of Indianapolis.

2167
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:53,381
Listen, we need to talk
about your unbilled hours

2168
01:53:53,382 --> 01:53:55,086
and these un-reimbursed...

(ringing)

2170
01:54:10,868 --> 01:54:12,399
Hello?

2171
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,167
WOMAN:
Mr. Bilott?

2172
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:15,670
Yes?

2173
01:54:15,671 --> 01:54:19,407
I guess I should start
by apologizing for taking...

2174
01:54:19,408 --> 01:54:22,144
- well, seven years to call you.
- Mm, who is this?

2175
01:54:22,145 --> 01:54:23,612
Oh, yes, of course.

2176
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:26,148
It's Dr. Karen Frank from the...

2177

Science panel?

2178
01:54:28,150 --> 01:54:30,719
Again, I'm so sorry to have

2179
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:33,188
- kept you waiting this long, Mr. Bilott.
- Uh...

2180
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:35,323
- But there was just so much data that...
- Please, uh...

2181
01:54:35,324 --> 01:54:38,326
Doctor, please, can you...
would you just please tell me

2182
01:54:38,328 --> 01:54:40,362
what-what's happened,
what's happening,

2183
01:54:40,363 --> 01:54:42,162
what-what-what-what
you've found out?

2184
01:54:42,164 --> 01:54:46,268
Yes, yes. You gave us an
unprecedented amount of data.

2185
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:49,671
The largest epidemiological
study in human history.

2186
01:54:49,672 --> 01:54:51,439
It's irrefutable.

2187
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,207
We have linked
sustained exposure to C-8

ulcerative colitis.

You did a good thing here,
Mr. Bilott.

2200
01:55:32,882 --> 01:55:34,752
You did good.

2201
01:55:36,587 --> 01:55:38,819
Thank you.

2202
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,823
¢Ü ¢Ü

2203
01:55:58,641 --> 01:56:00,645
¢Ü ¢Ü

2204
01:56:06,282 --> 01:56:07,884
(turns off engine)

2205
01:56:22,465 --> 01:56:24,467
- SARAH: Oh.
- Thank you.

2206
01:56:27,369 --> 01:56:28,836
(whispers):
Thank you.

2207
01:56:28,837 --> 01:56:30,907
(crying softly)

2208
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,481
(chuckles softly)

2209
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:44,752
¢Ü ¢Ü

2210
01:56:44,753 --> 01:56:46,756
(indistinct chatter)

2211
01:56:50,525 --> 01:56:52,929
ROB: Watch out, now.
Watch your eyes.

2212
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:56,930
- (flame whooshes)
- Oh!

2213
01:56:56,931 --> 01:56:58,935
¢Ü ¢Ü

2214
01:57:03,706 --> 01:57:05,708
(cell phone vibrating)

2215
01:57:18,054 --> 01:57:20,257
¢Ü ¢Ü

2216
01:57:30,865 --> 01:57:33,368
Rob?

2217
01:57:33,369 --> 01:57:35,273
What happened?

2218
01:57:38,673 --> 01:57:40,476
Rob?

2219
01:57:42,478 --> 01:57:45,282
DuPont, they're reneging.

2220
01:57:46,614 --> 01:57:48,115
Which part?

2221
01:57:48,118 --> 01:57:49,884
All of it.

2222
01:57:49,886 --> 01:57:51,752
They're tearing up
our agreement,

2223
01:57:51,753 --> 01:57:53,688
rejecting the science panel.

2224
01:57:53,689 --> 01:57:55,090
They're-they're gonna...
they're gonna...

2225
01:57:55,091 --> 01:57:57,091
they're gonna fight
every claim in court.

2226
01:57:57,092 --> 01:57:58,792
Thousands of claims.

2227
01:57:58,793 --> 01:58:01,028
People, sick people,
they'll give up.

2228
01:58:01,029 --> 01:58:02,895
They can't fight DuPont.

2229
01:58:02,898 --> 01:58:05,432
How can they go back o-on...?

2230
01:58:05,435 --> 01:58:07,100
- Sarah.
- They-they can't go back on everything.

2231
01:58:07,103 --> 01:58:08,769
Well, they're a titan
of industry.

2232
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:10,738
I mean, they can do
whatever the hell they want.

2233
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:11,606
Nothing else matters.

2234
01:58:11,609 --> 01:58:13,475
They-they can fight you
all they want.

2235
01:58:13,476 --> 01:58:15,109
It doesn't take away
from what you've done.

2236
01:58:15,110 --> 01:58:17,010
Of course it does.

2237
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:19,948
That's exactly what it does.

2238
01:58:19,949 --> 01:58:22,149
They want to show the world
it's no use fighting.

2239
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:24,786
"Look, everybody,
even he can't crack the maze,

2240
01:58:24,787 --> 01:58:26,655
and he helped build it."

2241
01:58:28,023 --> 01:58:30,625
The system is rigged.

2242
01:58:30,627 --> 01:58:33,661
They want us to think it'll
protect us, but that's a lie.

2243
01:58:33,662 --> 01:58:36,162
We protect us. We do.

2244
01:58:36,164 --> 01:58:38,466
Nobody else.

2245
01:58:38,467 --> 01:58:39,899
Not the companies,

2246
01:58:39,902 --> 01:58:41,667
not-not the...
not the scientists,

2247
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:42,970
not the government.

2248
01:58:42,971 --> 01:58:44,773
Us.

2249
01:58:44,774 --> 01:58:46,774
¢Ü ¢Ü

2250
01:58:46,775 --> 01:58:50,613
A farmer with a 12th-grade
education told me that.

2251
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:57,119
On day one, he knew, and I...
and I thought he was crazy.

2252
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:03,858
(chuckles softly)

2253
01:59:03,859 --> 01:59:05,695
Isn't that crazy?

2254
01:59:09,798 --> 01:59:11,667
(softly):
No.

2255
01:59:13,936 --> 01:59:15,939
¢Ü ¢Ü

2256
01:59:39,462 --> 01:59:41,465
¢Ü ¢Ü

2257
02:00:02,485 --> 02:00:04,488
¢Ü ¢Ü

2258
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:19,533
All rise.

2259
02:00:19,534 --> 02:00:22,036
The Honorable Timothy Burg,
United States District Judge

2260
02:00:22,037 --> 02:00:24,203
for the Southern District
of Ohio presiding.

2261
02:00:24,206 --> 02:00:26,908
This court is now in session
pursuant to the adjournment.

2262
02:00:26,909 --> 02:00:28,877
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

2263
02:00:28,878 --> 02:00:31,246
All persons having business
with this honorable court,

2264
02:00:31,247 --> 02:00:32,779
draw near,
give their attention,

2265
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:34,782
and they shall be heard.

2266
02:00:34,783 --> 02:00:37,149
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

2267
02:00:37,152 --> 02:00:39,019
- (gavel taps)
- Please be seated.

2268
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:41,854
And we're here this morning
for a jury trial.

2269
02:00:41,856 --> 02:00:43,925
So... (sighs)

2270
02:00:43,926 --> 02:00:46,894
3,535 claims.

2271
02:00:46,895 --> 02:00:49,697
At a rate of
four or five cases a year,

2272
02:00:49,698 --> 02:00:52,734
we can all expect
to be here till...

2273
02:00:52,735 --> 02:00:54,702
well, the year 2890.

2274
02:00:54,703 --> 02:00:56,104
If we're lucky.

2275
02:00:56,105 --> 02:00:57,904
Guess we'd better get started.

2276
02:00:57,907 --> 02:01:01,140
Mrs. Johnson,
is your attorney present?

2277
02:01:01,143 --> 02:01:02,644
Good morning, Your Honor.

2278
02:01:02,645 --> 02:01:04,645
Rob Bilott for the plaintiff.

2279
02:01:04,646 --> 02:01:06,914
Oh, still here, huh?

2280
02:01:06,917 --> 02:01:09,182
Still here.

2281
02:01:09,185 --> 02:01:11,186
¢Ü ¢Ü

2282
02:01:37,712 --> 02:01:39,716

02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,046
¢Ü Well, I won't ¢Ü

¢Ü Well, I know what's right ¢Ü

2300
02:03:23,819 --> 02:03:27,822
¢Ü I got just one life ¢Ü

¢Ü In a world that keeps on
pushin' me around ¢Ü

2302
02:03:32,194 --> 02:03:36,363
¢Ü But I'll stand my ground ¢Ü
